# Complete Codebook Inventory - All Unique Codes

**Date Generated**: 2025-12-07
**Source**: 28 coded interview documents in outputs/document_summaries/
**Total Unique Codes**: 2307
**Method**: Systematic extraction of all **Codes**: lines from coded documents

---

## Instructions for Use

This inventory contains EVERY code used across all 28 interviews, preserving exact formatting and hyphenation as written during the coding process. Codes are listed with:
- **Frequency**: Number of documents using this code
- **Raw format**: No consolidation or interpretation has been applied

**Next Steps for Codebook Consolidation**:
1. Review codes with frequency >= 3 for core patterns
2. Identify synonyms and variants (e.g., "campaign-vs-governing" vs "campaign-to-governance")
3. Group related codes into higher-order themes
4. Create hierarchical codebook with 1st-order (descriptive) and 2nd-order (analytical) codes
5. Map codes to theoretical constructs related to sycophancy
