**Date**: November 22, 1999
**Interviewee**: Robert Hartmann (Chief Speechwriter)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary

Key themes include resistance to Nixon holdovers, Ford's preference for collegial vs. hierarchical management, and contrasts between Ford's openness and Nixon's secretiveness.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Vice Presidential Subservience
> "Their anticipation was that a vice president who runs around, slavishly doing the will of his master all of a sudden becomes the master. He doesn't give a hoot what anybody else wants except, 'What do I want?'" (p.2)

**Codes**: sycophancy-vice-presidential-role, role-transformation, power-dynamics
**Memo**: Hartmann explicitly uses "slavishly" to describe VP behavior toward president. Suggests sycophancy is expected/institutionalized in VP role, but transforms when VP assumes presidency. Antecedent: positional hierarchy. Consequence: expectation shift creates conflict.

### 2. Staff Conflict and Power Struggle
> "We had a rather brutal war in which our side said the Nixon folks must go and their side said we're the only ones that know which way is up, you'd better listen to us." (p.2)

**Codes**: staff-conflict, expertise-vs-loyalty, transition-resistance
**Memo**: Nixon staffers expected deference based on experience; Ford team resisted. This is anti-sycophancy - refusing to defer despite knowledge gap. Shows sycophancy as contested, not automatic.

### 3. Loyalty as Liability
> "So being an old Nixon hand was not a badge of honor. Loyalty was not its own reward. The way it worked out, we tried all kinds of experiments in order to put Ford's stamp on this administration which had only two and some years to go before another election." (p.2-3)

**Codes**: loyalty-devalued, legitimacy-crisis, reputational-contamination
**Memo**: Nixon's disgrace inverted normal loyalty dynamics. Usually loyalty = asset; here = liability. Antecedent: predecessor's moral failure. Consequence: difficulty retaining institutional knowledge.

### 4. Selection Process - "Survival of the Fittest"
> "By bleeding. The side which bled the most lost. As time passed and people were tested in the new arrangement, it had the effect of survival of the fittest." (p.2)

**Codes**: meritocracy-through-conflict, testing-loyalty, darwinian-staffing
**Memo**: Staff sorted through attrition rather than planned selection. Suggests sycophancy reveals itself under pressure - those who couldn't adapt to new master left or were pushed out.

### 5. Leaders and Their Mirrors
> "The people that surrounded Ford tended to resemble them in their behavior and their patterns. Leaders surround themselves with people who are models of themselves. That's the best kind of subordinate." (p.5)

**Codes**: homophily, leader-staff-similarity, subordinate-selection
**Memo**: Hartmann articulates sycophancy as mirroring - leaders want staff who reflect them. But earlier (p.5) notes exception: "you don't pick someone who is too much like yourself, because then they will run for the job and take it away from you." Tension between wanting similarity and avoiding competition.

### 6. Reagan's Anti-Sycophantic Move
> "Now, in Reagan's case, he surrounded himself with people that were different from himself. For example, when he brought in Jim Baker, he brought in a person who was a Washington person; somebody who knew Washington well and had a lot of networks."
> RH: "Well, that was a smart thing to do." (p.5)

**Codes**: complementary-staffing, strategic-diversity, expertise-over-similarity
**Memo**: Hartmann praises Reagan for hiring someone unlike himself - opposite of sycophantic mirroring. Antecedent: self-awareness of own limitations. Consequence: more effective governance.

### 7. Reagan's Sycophantic Staff Culture
> "Reagan followed the Washington model of the presidency, in which he reigned, he presided. Most things got done and, if they really got too complicated for anybody else to settle, he would listen to it and pass judgment; everybody would say 'Yes sir, General' and go on from there." (p.5)

**Codes**: hierarchical-deference, ceremonial-leadership, staff-compliance
**Memo**: Despite hiring Baker, Reagan ran sycophantic operation where staff said "Yes sir, General." Suggests sycophancy can coexist with strategic staffing. Reagan's detachment enabled/required sycophantic staff responses.

### 8. Ford's Rejection of "Czar" Model
> MK: "Did Ford feel that the strong model of the chief of staff as a czar figure, it would model the Haldeman experiences—"
> RH: "That was part of it."
> MK: "—and he wanted to symbolically get away from that? So the staff became a symbol as well as a resource." (p.5)

**Codes**: symbolic-rejection, organizational-model, haldeman-reaction
**Memo**: Ford's spokes-of-wheel preference partly symbolic - rejecting Nixon's sycophantic Haldeman/Ehrlichman model. Antecedent: predecessor's abusive use of hierarchy. Consequence: organizational inefficiency, later reversal to chief of staff model.

### 9. Congressional vs. Presidential Culture
> "Ford really applied the good old legislative principle of let's compromise a little. That isn't a very good way for presidents to operate. He would discover that from time to time and he would blow his stack and pound on the table and say, 'This is the way it's going to be!'" (p.5)

**Codes**: congressional-habits, compromise-vs-command, role-transition-difficulty
**Memo**: Ford's congressional background = collaborative, anti-authoritarian. Presidential role demands hierarchy/compliance. His occasional outbursts show discomfort with sycophancy-demanding role.

### 10. Staff Purpose: Service vs. Self-Promotion
> "He should expect people to be working for him or, to put it more elegantly, for the country, rather than to promote themselves. Now this is kind of hard to find, and particularly among the kind of people who are attracted to political life because people attracted to political life are intensely competitive. They're not cooperators; they're not coordinators. They're conspirators." (p.6)

**Codes**: service-ideal, self-promotion, political-ambition
**Memo**: Hartmann articulates anti-sycophantic ideal: staff should serve president/country, not themselves. But recognizes impossibility - political people are "conspirators" not servants. Suggests genuine sycophancy (selfless service) conflicts with political ambition.

### 11. Pyramidal Structure and Sycophancy
> "However, the pyramid principle of leadership does work better in government positions because only one person has the real power anyway." (p.6)

**Codes**: hierarchical-necessity, structural-sycophancy, power-concentration
**Memo**: Hartmann endorses hierarchy for White House despite criticizing it earlier. Acknowledges structural reality: one person has power, therefore pyramid (which enables sycophancy) works best. Antecedent: concentrated authority. Consequence: hierarchy becomes functional necessity.

### 12. FDR's Machiavellian Management
> "I think, however, that's a difficult game to play. It takes a certain amount of diabolical skill, the kind that Franklin Roosevelt enjoyed. He really just loved playing with this art of managing people, and he did it superbly." (p.6)

**Codes**: manipulation, management-skill, Roosevelt-model
**Memo**: Hartmann admires FDR's manipulative leadership style. Suggests effective presidents create competition/uncertainty among staff - anti-sycophantic in that it prevents unified deference, but requires subordinates to perform sycophancy to gain favor.

### 13. Chief of Staff as "Son of a Bitch"
> "Well, that's it. You have a chief of staff who will be your son of a bitch." (p.7)

**Codes**: delegated-enforcement, bad-cop-role, chief-of-staff-function
**Memo**: Chief of staff role = doing president's dirty work. This is strategic sycophancy - subordinate absorbs blame to protect principal. Enables president to maintain image while wielding power.

### 14. Rumsfeld-Cheney Division of Labor
> "Rumsfeld, as one might expect of a good politician, brought [Dick] Cheney in and let him be the SOB. Rumsfeld wasn't going to make any enemies if he could help it. So Cheney made all the enemies and Rumsfeld got all the applause." (p.7)

**Codes**: strategic-role-division, blame-distribution, political-calculation
**Memo**: Rumsfeld used Cheney as buffer - Cheney performed dirty work while Rumsfeld maintained relationships. Multi-level sycophancy: both serve president, but Rumsfeld protects own position by delegating unpopular tasks. Consequence: Cheney's later career suggests this subordinate role didn't damage him.

### 15. Nixon Holdovers in Cabinet
> "We never really got rid of the Nixon people. If you look at the Ford Cabinet in the last days of his presidency you'll find that virtually without exception they are all Nixon people." (p.7)

**Codes**: personnel-continuity, incomplete-transition, cabinet-vs-white-house
**Memo**: Despite White House staff changes, Cabinet remained Nixon-appointed. Suggests sycophancy operates differently at Cabinet level - less direct loyalty, more institutional. Ford couldn't/didn't fully stamp government with his people.

### 16. Succession Legitimacy Deficit
> "I really think that if Ford had another four years in which he not only had time but also had the cachet of being a real president—a vice president who succeeds is never really president." (p.7-8)

**Codes**: legitimacy-deficit, succession-vs-election, constrained-authority
**Memo**: Lack of electoral mandate limited Ford's ability to demand loyalty/reshape administration. Antecedent: succession vs. election. Consequence: continued deference to predecessor's people/policies. Sycophancy requires recognized authority.

### 17. Ford's Transparency vs. Nixon's Secrecy
> "President Ford wanted to establish the fact that he was not using devious devices. His was an open White House, more or less, if I may use that expression." (p.13)

**Codes**: openness-as-strategy, transparency, anti-nixon-positioning
**Memo**: Ford's openness = deliberate rejection of Nixon's secretive style. Anti-sycophantic in refusing to control information flow. Consequence: cooperated with Woodward/Bernstein despite risks.

### 18. Ford's Inability to Lie
> "He couldn't lie. He was a lousy liar. Not only was he not well versed in the fine art of lying, he was morally trained that nice boys don't lie." (p.16)

**Codes**: honesty-as-constraint, moral-character, political-disadvantage
**Memo**: Ford's honesty prevented strategic dissembling that politics often requires. Anti-sycophantic trait - wouldn't tell people what they wanted to hear if untrue. Antecedent: moral upbringing. Consequence: pardon communication problems.

### 19. Hartmann's Relationship with Ford
> "We talked all the time, early in the morning and late at night. Of course, when he was president I didn't have the exclusive access to him that I had had before. While he was having his shower, I would be mixing the martinis and I would be watering his if he had to make a speech." (p.8)

**Codes**: intimate-access, relationship-change, personal-service
**Memo**: Hartmann performed personal services (mixing drinks) and had intimate access as VP aide. But presidency changed this - "you never get that kind of a relationship with a president no matter how close it's been in the past." Suggests presidency creates distance, requires more formal sycophancy.

### 20. Nixon's Intelligence and Strategic Use of Press
> "Nixon was an extremely smart man. He gobbled up and digested information—he was a fast learner. He understood the news business better than most people." (p.18)

**Codes**: media-manipulation, strategic-intelligence, nixon-competence
**Memo**: Hartmann (despite criticizing Nixon) acknowledges his abilities. Nixon strategically cultivated reporters, gave exclusives to Hartmann (Yalta papers) to "screw the New York Times." This is anti-sycophantic behavior by Nixon - using rather than deferring to press. But created sycophantic dynamic where reporters competed for his leaks.

### 21. Ford's Likability vs. News Value
> "The reporters just loved Ford but they didn't get much news out of him because the minority leader of the House doesn't make much news. That's why I was hired in the first place." (p.20)

**Codes**: personal-popularity, media-relations, role-constraints
**Memo**: Ford personally popular but low news value. Contrast with Nixon - feared but newsworthy. Suggests different forms of press relations: Ford = personal but not strategic; Nixon = strategic but adversarial. Neither purely sycophantic.

### 22. Speechwriter Invisibility Norm
> "My ultimatum to the other speechwriters always was that the function of a ghost is to be invisible. I still think that's a good rule." (p.11)

**Codes**: speechwriter-role, ghostwriting-norms, invisible-service
**Memo**: Hartmann enforces invisibility rule for speechwriters - classic sycophantic subordination. Words belong to president once spoken. But Hartmann violated this himself through book/interviews. Consequence: tension between ideal (invisibility) and reality (speechwriters seek credit).

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Institutional vs. Personal Loyalty**: Nixon people expected deference based on expertise; Ford people resisted despite knowledge gap
2. **Symbolic Rejection of Authoritarian Models**: Ford's spokes-of-wheel preference as reaction against Haldeman/Ehrlichman
3. **Succession Legitimacy**: Unelected status limited Ford's ability to demand loyalty and remake administration
4. **Congressional vs. Presidential Culture**: Congressional compromise habits vs. presidential command requirements
5. **Strategic vs. Blind Loyalty**: Reagan praised for hiring unlike himself; FDR admired for manipulating staff competition
6. **Delegated Enforcement**: Chief of staff as "SOB" who absorbs blame for president
7. **Transparency as Anti-Sycophancy**: Ford's openness vs. Nixon's secretiveness

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Predecessor's disgrace (Nixon) devalued loyalty
- Lack of electoral mandate weakened authority
- Congressional background created collaborative rather than hierarchical expectations
- Moral character (honesty) prevented strategic dissembling

**Manifestations**:
- Staff mirror leaders (homophily)
- "Yes sir, General" compliance (Reagan model)
- Delegated dirty work (chief of staff as SOB)
- Invisible service (ghostwriting)

**Consequences**:
- Organizational inefficiency from spokes-of-wheel model
- Staff conflict during transition
- Inability to fully remake administration
- Improved governance when hiring complementary expertise (Reagan-Baker)
