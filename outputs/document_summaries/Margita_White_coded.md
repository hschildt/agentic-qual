# Gerald R. Ford Transition - Margita White Interview
**Date**: October 26, 1999
**Interviewee**: Margita White (Director of Communications, Ford; Assistant to Director, Nixon)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
White discusses her experience across Nixon and Ford administrations, focusing on the evolution of the Communications Office. Key themes include the contrast between Klein's credibility-focused approach vs. Colson/Magruder's manipulative style, the corrupting influence of White House power on young staff, Ford's moral leadership, and the importance of setting ethical tone from the top.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Nixon's "Truth" Commitment - Stated vs. Actual Values
> "I was the one who drafted the statement by President Nixon that, 'Truth will be the hallmark of the Nixon Administration.' That was the commitment during the campaign, during the credibility gap that grew out of the [Lyndon B.] Johnson Administration, and the Vietnam War and so on." (p.2)

**Codes**: stated-values, credibility-gap, truth-as-rhetoric
**Memo**: White drafted Nixon's "truth will be hallmark" statement - profound irony given Watergate. Shows gap between stated organizational values and actual behavior. Antecedent: LBJ credibility gap created opportunity for truth rhetoric. Consequence: When truth rhetoric proved false, deeper cynicism resulted. Sycophancy thrives when stated values contradict actual norms.

### 2. Herb Klein's Credibility - Anti-Sycophantic Leadership
> "There was a great deal of press skepticism about the word 'director' as part of Communications Director because to the media...there was a certain connotation there of directing the press and directing news. That created a lot of paranoia in some of them. But I think the way Herb performed that function, I think that skepticism and concern was dispelled, because he was as straight arrow as anyone and everybody trusted him. People had the highest respect for him, as did I." (p.3)

**Codes**: trust, credibility, straight-arrow-leadership, anti-manipulation
**Memo**: Klein's credibility came from NOT being sycophantic - he was "straight arrow" and trustworthy. Press trusted him because he didn't manipulate. Antecedent: journalistic background and personal integrity. Consequence: respect from media and staff. Suggests sycophancy undermines credibility while integrity builds it.

### 3. Magruder's Secretiveness - Physical Barriers to Transparency
> "Well, when Jeb Magruder came in, he couldn't stand sharing an office with me, because there was so much he was doing he didn't want anybody to know, I guess. So one day, one weekend, they built a wall between the two of us... I was told about it but I had no say in it... That was my introduction, after about a month or two working with Jeb. It's probably just as well I wasn't listening in to every thing that was going on." (p.17-18)

**Codes**: secrecy, physical-barriers, exclusion, watergate-precursor
**Memo**: Magruder literally built a wall to hide his activities - physical manifestation of organizational secrecy. White had no say (powerlessness). Antecedent: illicit activities requiring concealment. Consequence: White protected from Watergate involvement by exclusion. Secrecy enables wrongdoing; sycophants don't question walls.

### 4. Plans Written to "Look Good" vs. Accomplish Results
> "I sort of kept track of them. But you had to have a plan for everything. It's coming back to me now. And sometimes I got very frustrated because the plans looked good on paper but it was more as if they were written—I've got to be very careful—to look good to those that had to approve them as opposed to being practical in terms of accomplishing the results that we sought to achieve." (p.14)

**Codes**: performance-over-substance, approval-seeking, haldeman-system, action-memos
**Memo**: Under Magruder/Haldeman, plans written to impress superiors rather than achieve results. Classic sycophancy - prioritizing what pleases boss over what works. Antecedent: hierarchical approval system with Haldeman. Consequence: ineffective operations, frustration. Shows how sycophantic culture distorts organizational outputs.

### 5. Colson Power Struggle - Refusing Sycophantic Loyalty Transfer
> "My area of frustration and concern was...when there was a power situation between Herb Klein and Chuck Colson. They were reorganizing the staff functions. Maybe it was in conjunction with the campaign. Colson wanted me to work for him. I went to Herb and said, 'No, I'll quit before that.'" (p.18)

**Codes**: loyalty-choice, refusing-assignment, colson-rejection, principled-stand
**Memo**: White refused to work for Colson - would quit rather than transfer loyalty to someone she found problematic. Anti-sycophantic stand based on principles. Antecedent: Colson's reputation and methods. Consequence: stayed with Klein, avoided Watergate entanglement. Shows sycophancy as choice - can refuse loyalty to problematic leaders.

### 6. Gordon Liddy - Recognizing Dangerous Actors
> "I sat down with Liddy, he told me his plans and we walked through this. I went back to Herb afterwards and said, 'This isn't going to work and I'm not going to work with this person.' So he was taken off of it and I did it myself...I just went back and said, 'This man is kind of crazy.'" (p.18)

**Codes**: warning-signs, refusing-collaboration, preventing-wrongdoing
**Memo**: White recognized Liddy as "crazy" and refused to work with him - early warning sign ignored by others. Anti-sycophantic act: speaking up about problematic colleague. Antecedent: good judgment and willingness to dissent. Consequence: Liddy removed from her project (but not from White House). Sycophants don't call people "crazy"; they go along.

### 7. Ford Restoring Respect - Anti-Sycophantic Leadership
> "I have such a tremendous respect for most of the people I got to know who worked for President Ford, but most of all for President Ford. He was so right for the country at that time; it was such a shame that he wasn't re-elected. But you have to remember that I went back to 1959 working for Richard Nixon, and it was tough on a lot of us, what happened. And Ford sort of helped restore a lot of the—what's the word I'm looking for—respect and the aura of the White House for me and the presidency." (p.13)

**Codes**: restoration, moral-leadership, post-watergate-healing, ford-decency
**Memo**: Ford restored respect after Nixon's disgrace. For those who'd served Nixon, Ford provided moral redemption. Antecedent: Watergate trauma and disillusionment. Consequence: renewed belief in presidency and public service. Suggests sycophancy flourishes under corrupted leaders, diminishes under decent ones.

### 8. Communications Office Evolution - From Credibility to Manipulation
> "The Office of Communications changed dramatically from what it was under Herb, what it became as Chuck Colson moved in with his input, and Jeb Magruder moved into the Office, and then when Ken Clawson took over, and then when Watergate came about... I wanted it to be that way. In fact, we didn't even use the Office of Communications [title] much in those days and certainly 'Director of Communications' was not, I think, a title that Jerry even used when he came in." (p.13)

**Codes**: office-evolution, title-rejection, symbolic-distancing, post-watergate-low-profile
**Memo**: Office transformed from Klein's credible operation to Colson/Clawson's manipulative one. White deliberately lowered profile and changed title to distance from Watergate-era practices. Antecedent: Watergate stigma. Consequence: restored credibility through humility. Shows sycophantic operations leave lasting damage requiring symbolic repair.

### 9. Title Change - "Director OF Communications" vs. "Director, Communications"
> "Instead of being Director of Communications, I wanted my title to be Director of the Office of Communications, because I wanted to get away from that aura that came out under the Clawson operation, that we directed communications, and I wanted to be more facilitative." (p.13)

**Codes**: symbolic-language, facilitation-vs-direction, rejecting-control
**Memo**: Subtle but important title change from "Director of Communications" to "Director of the Office of Communications" - rejecting controlling connotation for facilitative one. Anti-sycophantic move: serving rather than directing. Antecedent: Clawson's manipulative reputation. Consequence: different relationship with media and staff.

### 10. Klein vs. Ziegler Credibility Differential
> "Well, the difference, of course, was that Herb came in to that with much more experience and maturity and news judgment and media life than I did coming in to it. [Inaudible.] I didn't come out of the journalism profession. So I was not considered a peer by the journalism profession, as Herb was." (p.13-14)

**Codes**: peer-credibility, journalism-background, professional-respect
**Memo**: Klein's journalism background gave him credibility as peer that others lacked. Suggests sycophancy harder when you're insider to the group you might manipulate - journalists trust journalists. Ziegler lacked this peer status, easier to be sycophant. Antecedent: professional background. Consequence: different media relationships.

### 11. Young People Losing Moral Compass
> "I think that's what happened to some of the younger people in the Nixon administration, the Watergate, including some of the young people that worked with Jeb. They are so excited and so imbued with the power that they seem to forget why they have the power and what it's for. You certainly want to be loyal to your boss and to your leader, but you have to step back and if you have questions, ask yourself why do you have the questions?" (p.21-22)

**Codes**: power-corruption, youthful-inexperience, excitement-over-judgment, watergate-explanation
**Memo**: Young Nixon staffers "imbued with power" forgot its purpose - classic corruption narrative. White identifies excitement/awe as antecedent to losing moral compass. Tension between loyalty ("want to be loyal") and conscience ("ask yourself why"). Antecedent: youth, inexperience, proximity to power. Consequence: Watergate crimes. Sycophancy as failure to maintain critical distance.

### 12. Tone Set by President
> MK: "So where does the direction need to come from?"
> MW: "That direction should come from the president, absolutely." (p.22)

**Codes**: presidential-tone-setting, top-down-ethics, leadership-responsibility
**Memo**: White unequivocal: ethical direction must come from president. Leaders set tone that enables or constrains sycophancy. Ford example: "he didn't have to say that much, but you knew where he was coming from...you knew he was a decent man who believed in public service being public service." Antecedent: presidential character. Consequence: staff behavior follows leader's model.

### 13. Chief of Staff and Senior Leadership Critical
> "But the tone should begin with the president. But within a White House structure, the next layer is probably as important as anything—the chief of staff and these offices that you all are looking into. Their functions can vary, but they need to be the kind of men and women who have the experience—not necessarily the age, but have the experience—to know what's right and to lead both by example and by giving orders. That's where part of those problems came from in the Nixon administration, à la Chuck Colson." (p.22)

**Codes**: chief-of-staff-importance, leading-by-example, colson-as-problem, experience-matters
**Memo**: Second layer (CoS, senior staff) "probably as important as anything" for setting ethical tone. Must "know what's right and lead by example." Explicitly identifies Colson as source of problems. Suggests sycophancy enabled by unethical second layer even when president not directly ordering wrongdoing. Antecedent: choosing people like Colson. Consequence: Watergate-type problems.

### 14. Refusing to Work for Colson - Principled Line Drawing
> "As I told you, what I would have done was, I would have quit if I had to work for him. That was the situation that I was faced with." (p.22)

**Codes**: quit-threat, principled-refusal, colson-rejection, exit-option
**Memo**: White would have quit rather than work for Colson - ultimate anti-sycophantic stance. Willingness to exit rather than comply with problematic authority. Antecedent: clear principles and financial ability to leave. Consequence: maintained integrity. Shows sycophancy as choice with exit as alternative.

### 15. Loss of Moral Compass - Watergate Explanation
> "I don't want to go into names, but some of the people that worked with Jeb—and Jeb himself—I think they lost their moral compass and probably never realized they weren't serving the greater good when they were not." (p.22)

**Codes**: moral-compass-loss, self-deception, greater-good-rhetoric
**Memo**: Watergate participants "lost their moral compass" and didn't realize they weren't serving greater good - suggests self-deception common in sycophantic wrongdoing. Thought they were being loyal/serving but actually doing harm. Antecedent: power, excitement, groupthink. Consequence: criminal behavior rationalized as service.

### 16. Balance and Perspective - Protection Against Sycophancy
> "For that reason I think I had a better balance than a lot of the men did, certainly [because] I was a woman; and I never knew I was going to have a career in the first place. So it wasn't as if the whole world depended on my supporting them [the family]...I wasn't that sensitive to where my future was going...If they didn't want me there the next day, so be it." (p.16)

**Codes**: career-detachment, gender-difference, exit-readiness, balanced-perspective
**Memo**: White's "better balance" came from not being career-dependent on position - as woman in 1970s, didn't expect career, so less invested. "If they didn't want me there the next day, so be it." Antecedent: gender norms limiting career expectations. Consequence: independence, less susceptible to sycophancy. Paradox: marginalization as protection against corruption.

### 17. Pride in Long Hours - Toxic Competition
> "There's almost a sense of pride of how long you work and how many hours you put in, and so on, and that's wrong." (p.25)

**Codes**: hours-competition, performance-of-commitment, toxic-culture
**Memo**: White identifies pride in overwork as wrong - competitive display of commitment. Sycophantic performance: showing dedication through suffering. Antecedent: White House intensity and competition. Consequence: imbalance, burnout. Notes this as pattern across administrations.

### 18. Awe Never Fading - Sustaining Wonder vs. Corruption
> "There is such an excitement of working for the President of the United States, in the White House, the leader of the world. If you ever lose that sense of excitement, you don't belong there. I really think that. I never lost it; I left for other reasons." (p.25)

**Codes**: sustained-awe, excitement, belonging-criteria
**Memo**: White says excitement should never fade - "if you ever lose that sense of excitement, you don't belong there." Tension: earlier noted young people "so excited and so imbued with the power" that they lost moral compass. So excitement can corrupt OR sustain. Difference may be whether excitement is about service or power. Healthy awe vs. corrupting awe.

### 19. Reinventing the Wheel - Arrogance of New Administrations
> "I think it's like everybody wants to reinvent the wheel when they get there; they're the first people who've ever been elected and been there and had this opportunity. If they could learn a little bit more from the experience of others it might be of assistance to them in going forward. It also might temper the arrogance of some." (p.24)

**Codes**: institutional-memory, arrogance, reinvention, learning-resistance
**Memo**: Each administration thinks it's first/unique - refuses to learn from predecessors. Arrogance prevents learning. Anti-sycophantic recommendation: "learn from experience of others" and "temper arrogance." Antecedent: electoral victory creates hubris. Consequence: repeated mistakes. Sycophants reinforce leader's sense of uniqueness rather than encouraging learning.

### 20. Pat Barrio Transition - Offering Non-Partisan Help
> "After I left and after Carter won the White House, I sought out the woman whose name escapes me who came in after that...I suggested that we have lunch and I would be happy to share some of my experience and observations with her to help her in dealing with that job." (p.23-24)

**Codes**: cross-party-cooperation, institutional-continuity, professional-service
**Memo**: White (Republican) reached out to Barrio (Democrat) to share knowledge - anti-partisan, pro-institutional behavior. "It's not that partisan. You have a job to do and you have to work at it." Antecedent: professional commitment over party loyalty. Consequence: better transitions. Anti-sycophantic: serving institution over party.

### 21. Self-Imposed vs. External Pressure
> MK: "What kind of pressure is it? Where does it come from?"
> MW: "I think a lot of it with me was self-imposed because there was no way I could do everything I wanted to do. That's sort of a starting point. I think that's true with everyone; there's so much more you could do if you work just a little more, a little stronger, a little healthier, a little wiser." (p.16)

**Codes**: self-imposed-pressure, perfectionism, overwork-drivers
**Memo**: Much pressure "self-imposed" - wanting to do everything. Perfectionism drives sycophantic overwork as much as external demands. Antecedent: high standards and opportunity. Consequence: unsustainable pace. Suggests sycophancy can be internal (self-directed) not just response to others.

### 22. Backbiting and Job Insecurity
> MK: "How does it manifest itself?"
> MW: "There's always a little bit of backbiting and all that, probably more there than elsewhere, but that's never been a big concern to me."
> MK: "Is it anymore than in any other kind of place?"
> MW: "I think so. Absolutely." (p.16)

**Codes**: backbiting, job-insecurity, competition, white-house-culture
**Memo**: More backbiting in White House than elsewhere. Kumar later notes "general job insecurity, and the fact that there are people who always wanted your job or wanted you out of your job...open season on everybody else." Antecedent: proximity to power, limited positions. Consequence: toxic environment. Sycophancy upward, backstabbing laterally.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Stated vs. Actual Values**: Nixon's "truth will be hallmark" rhetoric vs. Watergate reality
2. **Credibility Through Integrity**: Klein's effectiveness came from being "straight arrow," not manipulative
3. **Secrecy and Concealment**: Magruder literally building wall; plans written to look good rather than work
4. **Young Staff Corruption**: Power and excitement causing loss of "moral compass"
5. **Presidential Tone-Setting**: Ford's decency vs. Nixon/Colson's approach
6. **Principled Refusal**: White would quit rather than work for Colson
7. **Title Symbolism**: Rejecting "Director of Communications" for less controlling title
8. **Professional Background**: Journalism credentials created peer credibility Klein had, Ziegler lacked
9. **Gender and Independence**: Marginal career status provided protection from capture
10. **Institutional Memory**: Each administration's arrogance in reinventing wheel

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Youth and inexperience (young Nixon staffers)
- Excitement about proximity to power
- Hierarchical approval systems (Haldeman action memos)
- Unethical second-tier leaders (Colson)
- Career dependence and ambition
- Electoral victory creating hubris

**Manifestations**:
- Plans written to please rather than accomplish
- Secrecy and concealment (building walls)
- Loss of moral compass while thinking one serves "greater good"
- Pride in overwork as performance of commitment
- Refusing to learn from predecessors
- Self-imposed perfectionism and pressure

**Consequences**:
- Watergate crimes and cover-up
- Organizational ineffectiveness
- Burnout and turnover
- Credibility loss
- Need for post-scandal rehabilitation (changing titles, lowering profile)
- Lasting damage requiring next administration to distance itself

**Protective Factors** (Anti-Sycophancy):
- Professional credibility from journalism background
- Clear personal principles and willingness to quit
- Balanced perspective from not being career-dependent
- Speaking up about problematic actors (Liddy)
- Setting facilitative rather than controlling tone
- Cross-party institutional service
- Moral leadership from president (Ford)

## Notable Comparison: Klein vs. Colson/Magruder/Clawson

White's account shows clear evolution:
- **Klein era**: Credibility, transparency, peer respect, "straight arrow"
- **Colson/Magruder era**: Manipulation, secrecy, plans for approval, power struggles
- **Clawson era**: "Cocktails with Clawson," hard image, Watergate
- **Warren/White era (Ford)**: Low profile, rehabilitation, facilitating not directing

Suggests same office can enable or resist sycophancy depending on leadership.
