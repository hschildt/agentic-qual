# Jimmy Carter Transition - Arnie Miller Interview
**Date**: December 16, 1999
**Interviewee**: Arnie Miller (Director, Office of Presidential Personnel, 1978-1981)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Miller discusses the Carter transition and personnel operation, focusing on transition dynamics, integration of campaign and transition teams, teamwork-building through hiring, and the challenges of reclaiming centralized personnel authority. Key themes include the Watson-Jordan power struggle, the importance of competence vs. pure loyalty, and strategies for making appointees feel connected to the President.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Transition Failure: Campaign vs. Transition People
> "Much of the work in the Carter transition was to naught, or a lot of it, because of the failure of the transition effort to integrate with the political effort at the very beginning. Carter tilted toward Hamilton Jordan much of the work that [Jack] Watson had been developing and doing. It didn't sort of sustain itself. Some of it did. But there was this sort of wholesale shift almost from one locus to another. I think that influenced a lot of structure of the administration. A fateful mistake, I think." (p.2)

**Codes**: transition-conflict, loyalty-over-planning, campaign-vs-transition, power-shift, structural-consequences
**Memo**: Carter chose campaign loyalist Jordan over transition planner Watson despite Watson's preparation work. This is sycophancy antecedent - preferring personal loyalty/familiarity over expertise. Consequence: much transition work wasted, poor administrative structure. Shows tension between those who "earned" position through campaign vs. those selected for competence.

### 2. Legitimacy Through Campaign Connection
> "Sandy Berger was Clinton's designee as the head of the national security cluster. Sandy had been intimately involved with Clinton from the very beginning. He was heavily involved on the substantive side of the campaign, not the field organization but was clearly a member of the campaign. So, when Clinton anointed him as the head of the national security cluster, he brought with him a kind of legitimacy that other people might not have automatically had." (p.2)

**Codes**: campaign-legitimacy, insider-status, anointing-authority, trust-through-proximity
**Memo**: "Legitimacy" comes from campaign involvement, not expertise. Berger had "foot in both camps" making transition easier. Contrast with Ford/Nixon - here legitimacy = personal connection to president-elect. Antecedent for sycophancy: those with campaign ties have automatic authority others lack. Successfully integrated because trusted, not necessarily because qualified.

### 3. Transition Mindset: "Us Until They Can Come"
> "The mindset at the beginning has to be not: 'Us against them', but, 'Us until they can come.' And then there needs to be a way to—every administration that I can think of—. Reagan who did a much better job, I think, in terms of the transition, still had that revolt from [Lyn] Nofziger, where he basically cut off Pen[dleton] James' legs for a while, complaining that there weren't enough true believers, Reagan people with real commitment." (p.2-3)

**Codes**: loyalty-demands, true-believers, ideological-purity, insider-revolt, transition-deference
**Memo**: Even well-managed Reagan transition had loyalty conflicts. Nofziger demanded "true believers" - explicit sycophancy expectation. "Real commitment" = personal loyalty, not competence. Miller advocates transition people accepting they're temporary placeholders - institutionalizing deference to campaign insiders. Antecedent: expectation that campaign loyalty trumps transition expertise.

### 4. Campaign Team Entitlement to Govern
> "Here you engage in a two-year, three-year effort to become president; you surround yourself with a team of people, some fall off, some survive. But you've come through this experience together. By the end it's almost expected and understood that this team in some combination is going to move into the White House and govern. The skills you need to run a campaign aren't exactly the same skills you need to govern, but go tell that to a president who has just come through a tremendous ordeal with a team that has succeeded, finally, and one whose strengths and weaknesses he knows and trusts." (p.3)

**Codes**: campaign-entitlement, loyalty-over-skills, trust-through-ordeal, governing-vs-campaigning
**Memo**: Critical insight - campaign creates expectation of governing roles regardless of skill match. President "knows and trusts" campaign team, creating automatic deference to them over potentially better-qualified outsiders. Antecedent: shared hardship creates bonds that trump competence considerations. Miller acknowledges mismatch (campaign ≠ governing skills) but explains why presidents ignore this. Example: Stephanopoulos and Dee Dee Myers in communications - didn't work well, had to bring in seasoned McCurry later.

### 5. Vice President's People Integration
> "Carter and [Walter] Mondale came together in August, and by November they were much more closely connected. And Mondale succeeded in bringing into the White House staff a substantial number of people with Carter's approval, in a variety of places in addition to his own, as they were with [Al] Gore, as they were with [George H. W.] Bush. [James] Baker would be the leading example of that, I suspect." (p.3)

**Codes**: vice-presidential-patronage, shared-staffing, power-sharing, delayed-integration
**Memo**: VP brings own people but not immediately - "took a while." VP staff initially separate, then integrated. Baker from Bush to Reagan example of VP bringing seasoned Washington hand. This is anti-sycophantic when done well - bringing competence rather than just loyalists. But Miller notes it doesn't happen "from day one."

### 6. Carter Gave Away Hiring, Miller Brought to Take It Back
> AM: "He gave away hiring. I was brought in to take it back."
> MK: "Taking it back—"
> AM: "Is much harder." (p.5)

**Codes**: delegated-authority, recentralization-difficulty, personnel-power, departmental-autonomy
**Memo**: Carter initially decentralized hiring to departments - consistent with his "devolution of power to the Cabinet." But this created problems requiring Miller's 1978 intervention. Once autonomy granted, very hard to reclaim - departments resist. Shows tension between Cabinet autonomy (anti-sycophantic decentralization) vs. White House control (enabling loyalty screening). Miller succeeded with some departments (Commerce, HHS) but struggled with others (Pentagon, HEW).

### 7. Battle Over "Political Reliability" vs. Competence
> "We were having, when I took over the personnel office in 1978, difficulty with the Pentagon. And we went into a terrific battle over two words. His [Charles Duncan's] definition of the role of the personnel office was to review the political reliability of candidates nominated or recommended to the president for different positions. And I said, '…and competence.' I thought the Personnel Office ought to have a little bit more. That's all I wanted to change in his entire memo." (p.5)

**Codes**: loyalty-vs-competence, personnel-office-role, pentagon-resistance, two-word-battle
**Memo**: Explicit conflict over sycophancy! Duncan wanted Personnel Office limited to "political reliability" screening - pure loyalty test. Miller insisted on adding "and competence." This battle exemplifies core tension: should personnel function ensure loyalty or quality? Miller frames adding competence as enabling "teambuilding" but Carter didn't support him. Antecedent: departmental resistance to White House personnel control. Consequence: Miller couldn't fully implement competence standard.

### 8. Teambuilding Through Hiring Process
> "It was less a question of the Personnel Office suddenly acquiring more power—I wouldn't argue against that—but more using the hiring process to build a sense of teamwork. So it was to use people on [Zbigniew] Brzezinski's staff, use people on McIntyre's staff at OMB, in the interview process, because here were people with whom the appointees in the end were going to have to work. So, start at the appointments process...it was an effort to use the hiring process and the recruiting process to start building that sense of teamwork between the White House and the other agencies." (p.5)

**Codes**: teambuilding-through-hiring, collaborative-vetting, relationship-building, anti-hierarchical-approach
**Memo**: Miller's innovative anti-sycophantic approach - involve substantive experts in hiring so appointees know colleagues before starting. Reduces "Us vs. Them" dynamic. Uses personnel process to build genuine collaboration rather than hierarchical compliance. Henry Owen's idea but Miller implemented it. Consequence: "gave people less of a sense of 'Us and them.'"

### 9. White House Contempt for Departments
> "There was so much contempt in some instances for the White House—one Cabinet member used to talk about 'little boys in short pants running around'—that we had to reconstruct somehow some mutual respect, and that required changing the people in the White House [inaudible]—clean everybody out. But also re-establishing the ways—believe me, it didn't start at the beginning and it's harder to do." (p.6)

**Codes**: contempt-for-white-house, age-inexperience, little-boys-in-short-pants, mutual-disrespect, mid-term-correction
**Memo**: Carter's Cabinet devolution created White House credibility crisis - Cabinet viewed WH staff as inexperienced children. Opposite of sycophantic deference - outright contempt. Consequence: had to bring in mid-term reinforcements (Miller, Ann Wexler, Robert Strauss) - "been around" people to rebuild respect. Shows danger of giving too much autonomy too early without establishing WH authority.

### 10. "Early People, Their Arrogance, Ignorance and Adrenaline"
> MK: "How can those people be effectively brought in at the beginning, so you have a minimum of a period where the White House is characterized by what Richard Neustadt calls: 'The early people, their arrogance, ignorance and adrenaline?'"
> AM: "Well, a new perspective if you want to be a little charitable, a fresh perspective." (p.6)

**Codes**: early-people-syndrome, arrogance-ignorance-adrenaline, campaign-hubris, washington-establishment-critique
**Memo**: Neustadt's classic formulation captures anti-sycophantic aspect of transitions - campaign people's arrogance. But Miller notes this is politically necessary: "so much of success rides on one's ability to discredit the Washington establishment." Can't run against Washington then immediately staff with Washington insiders. Creates structural problem: electoral incentives produce incompetent early staffing.

### 11. Reagan's Delegation and Mature Staffing
> "I admired Reagan for doing that [bringing in James Baker]. I have a lot of problems philosophically and ideologically and so forth. They were mature about how they assembled a lot of people." (p.7)

**Codes**: reagan-model, mature-staffing, strategic-personnel, delegation-success
**Memo**: Miller (Democrat) praises Reagan's personnel approach despite ideological disagreement. "Mature" = willing to let transition operate separately ("kitchen cabinet"), bring in people unlike himself (Baker), delegate effectively. Contrast with Clinton who "couldn't let go" (see next excerpt). Reagan's self-awareness about own limits = anti-sycophantic. But earlier Ford interview noted Reagan's staff still said "Yes sir, General" - so mature hiring didn't prevent sycophantic culture.

### 12. Clinton's Need for Control
> "Clinton's mess in the early period in terms of the speed of appointments and so forth was primarily the result of his own desire and need to be heavily involved...Clinton went to an extreme. I can tell you, Cabinet members I talked with, in the first few months, eight months, were complaining to me about how stuff was sitting on his desk for advisory committees. Advisory committees." (p.7)

**Codes**: presidential-micromanagement, control-needs, appointment-delays, bottleneck-at-top
**Memo**: Clinton's need to personally approve even advisory committee appointments created bottleneck. Requires all decisions flow through him = structural sycophancy enabler. Everyone must wait for president's approval. Miller's article said "then of course you can't ignore the President" and Clinton probably reacted negatively. Antecedent: president's personality (inability to delegate). Consequence: slow appointments, Cabinet frustration. Contrast with Reagan's delegation.

### 13. "Corruption" - Excessive Use of White House Without Institutional Appreciation
> "I was just thinking about what I'll call—corruption is too strong a word—the excessive use of the White House. It came from people who didn't have an appreciation of the institution. The Lincoln bedroom stuff; limits. There's nothing wrong with bringing political people there, using the White House for all that, but people just didn't appreciate it. And that comes from experience. Some of my own friends who were new to all that—who knows where it started? Certainly he wasn't unaware of all that...You need people around with an appreciation about what all that stuff represents." (p.8)

**Codes**: institutional-respect, lincoln-bedroom-scandal, inexperience-consequences, limits-of-propriety
**Memo**: Clinton's Lincoln Bedroom scandal as failure of institutional appreciation, not corruption per se. Inexperienced staff didn't understand boundaries. Connects to earlier "little boys in short pants" - lack of institutional knowledge enables inappropriate behavior. Not quite sycophancy but related: newcomers lacking restraint that experience provides. Antecedent: staffing with campaign people who don't know Washington norms. Consequence: scandals that damage presidency.

### 14. Primary Process Creates Personal Obligations
> "The process by now, of campaigning, develops very personal relationships between the President and interest groups, state senators all over the country. So the expectations are no longer directed toward departments. They are; sure they are. But the connection between the President and the country, a lot through the primary process I suspect, almost requires the capacity to relate to different groups and different interests and specific people...If McCain gets nominated, or whatever, he's going to owe a lot to fifty people or seventy-five people in South Carolina, who never had that kind of access of power." (p.8)

**Codes**: primary-process-obligations, personal-connections, expectation-management, decentralized-loyalty-demands
**Memo**: Structural analysis of how modern primaries create sycophancy pressure. President now personally owes state-level actors who helped in primaries. "Never had that kind of access of power" before - creates expectation of personal relationship with president. Requires White House staff capacity to manage these relationships - can't just go through departments. Antecedent: modern primary system. Consequence: need larger WH staff, more direct presidential involvement in managing political obligations.

### 15. Centralization of Power - Nixon to Reagan
> "Two, the centralization of power, which started with Nixon—well, [Lyndon] Johnson didn't do so badly at it, either. But, as government grew, the White House has become—Carter tried to decentralize and failed at it. That was part of his trouble. Reagan, certainly on personnel matters and policy matters, as well, continued the tradition started in Johnson [and] Nixon. So it isn't enough to have talent in the bureaucracy. It has to be countervailed or aided by the issue." (p.8)

**Codes**: centralization-trend, carter-decentralization-failure, white-house-power-growth, nixon-johnson-legacy
**Memo**: Historical trajectory toward White House centralization. Carter's attempt to decentralize (Cabinet government) "failed" - "that was part of his trouble." Reagan continued centralization despite rhetoric. This centralization enables sycophancy - all roads lead to White House, all appointees must please WH personnel office. Antecedent: government growth. Consequence: need strong WH staff to counterbalance departments, creating hierarchical approval structures.

### 16. Healthcare Task Force Bypassed Normal Process
> "There was such a naiveté about this town, and how pressures are brought to bear, that they were just ambushed and destroyed over it. Now, I don't know whether including that in the process, having that whole stuff to come up through a more organized process, would have made a difference. I think they missed. It was partly that, but I think it was also a political naiveté where they didn't anticipate not necessarily—maybe it would have required inclusion, but they didn't anticipate and plan for the reaction that was going to occur." (p.9)

**Codes**: bypassing-process, healthcare-failure, political-naivete, hillary-clinton-role, side-access-danger
**Memo**: Healthcare task force went outside normal staffing process. "If you had had a good staffing process in place, with a strong chief of staff, that made sure that you couldn't bypass the system, then you probably would not have had that." Process bypass enabled by Hillary's role - one of "three loci of power" that complicated normal hierarchy. Consequence of allowing side channels: political ambush. Shows value of process discipline vs. sycophantic personal access.

### 17. Awe of Working in White House
> MK: "Why did you turn them down?"
> AM: "They weren't substantive enough. One job was to head up all of the public affairs efforts for the reorganization project. My response was, I didn't want to be the person carrying the message; I wanted to be the person that the message was brought to. So I wanted to have the power to do something, as opposed to being a message carrier."
> MK: "Generally, I don't think they do have them [substantive conversations about roles]."
> AM: "Probably not. You're so awed by the whole idea of it." (p.11)

**Codes**: awe-of-office, power-vs-service, message-carrier-vs-decision-maker, lack-of-negotiation
**Memo**: Miller unusual in turning down WH jobs twice before accepting right one. Most people "awed" and accept without negotiating role. This awe creates sycophancy - people so honored to be asked they don't ensure job gives them real authority. Miller wanted "power to do something" not just carry messages for others. Anti-sycophantic move: demanding substance before accepting. Most don't have "substantive conversation" about expectations before taking WH jobs.

### 18. Learning from Predecessors
> "Yes. Something that I didn't find these guys doing enough of, in the Clinton White House. But I called in the guy that did it for Ford; I spent time talking to him. I recruited John Macy, who had done it for Johnson. He had just come back from Iran. I asked him to serve as the head of FEMA and used him over time. Then, I went to visit a man named Frank Pace, who had served as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget under Harry Truman and then as Secretary of the Army." (p.11)

**Codes**: institutional-memory, learning-from-predecessors, cross-administration-cooperation, anti-arrogance
**Memo**: Miller proactively sought advice from Ford and Johnson personnel directors. "Didn't find these guys doing enough of" in Clinton WH - connects to earlier themes of arrogance. Reagan people also initially resisted (see White coded doc: "reinventing-wheel" code). Anti-sycophantic behavior: valuing expertise over partisan loyalty. Miller brought in Macy, Pace as advisors despite party differences. Contrast with typical pattern of rejecting predecessor's advice due to electoral arrogance.

### 19. Robert Strauss as Daily Advisor
> MK: "How often would you talk to him?"
> AM: "Regularly. He would call me every day, every couple days. We did a lot of work together." (p.12)

**Codes**: senior-advisor-access, regular-consultation, strauss-role, political-wisdom
**Memo**: Strauss - senior Democratic wise man - called Miller daily. Used for political advice, candidate recommendations, negotiations (Teamsters/ICC example). This is positive version of proximity power - Miller sought guidance from more experienced political operative. Not sycophantic because Miller retained decision authority, but shows importance of having trusted senior advisor with regular access.

### 20. Balancing Multiple Pressures - ICC Example
> "The personnel process is an important ingredient, but also a good example of how the president has to balance a variety of forces." (p.13)

> "That's the way the personnel process, in part, has to be viewed. It can't just be that. You can't just take, sort of, Neustadt's theory about balancing all these political interests and coming out with the best result. I think you need that, and you can't ignore that, but you have to pay a little attention to talent and make sure from a policy standpoint as well." (p.13)

**Codes**: balancing-multiple-forces, neustadt-bargaining, talent-vs-politics, personnel-as-balancing-act
**Memo**: Miller's sophisticated view - personnel decisions must balance: (1) political obligations (Teamsters seat), (2) policy goals (deregulation), (3) diversity/representation (minority candidate), (4) individual merit. Used ICC expansion to give Teamsters their seat while maintaining deregulation majority plus adding qualified minority economist. Not pure sycophancy (giving Teamsters what they want) nor pure meritocracy - strategic balancing. Shows personnel as "balancing a variety of forces" not just loyalty test.

### 21. Opening Up to Interest Groups - No Guarantees
> "I opened it up and I brought in minority groups. I said, 'Here are the vacancies. Go for it. I'm not hiding anything. Bring us candidates. You're not going to get all of them, but bring us people! Here's what we need in each of those places.'...You have to make it quite clear at the front end: 'No guarantees; we're not telling you, "Here go fill this job!", we're telling you, "We want people and we want you to understand the kinds of people…"', and so on. They'll get their share. People are sophisticated enough to know they're going to get their share, and there's always a next time." (p.13-14)

**Codes**: transparent-outreach, interest-group-engagement, no-guarantees-policy, network-building
**Memo**: Miller's approach to diversity hiring - proactive outreach to women's groups (Judy Lichtman), minority groups, but explicit "no guarantees." This balances inclusion (anti-sycophantic broadening of networks) with merit (no automatic appointments). Groups accept because "they'll get their share" and "there's always a next time" - repeated game creates cooperation without sycophantic compliance. "People are sophisticated enough" - treats them as partners not supplicants.

### 22. Carter's Judgeships - Advisory Committees and White House Role
> "Well, Carter did that, I think, to good advantage. I think he had advisory committees in every circuit for the appeals court judges. Mostly, to the members of the Senate, he left the district court judges. But there was a pretty aggressive outreach effort done by some of the national groups here to identify and promote candidates that then made their way through the process." (p.14)

**Codes**: judicial-advisory-committees, senatorial-courtesy, white-house-judicial-role, diversification-effort
**Memo**: Carter innovated advisory committees for circuit court judges - reduced senatorial patronage, increased WH role and diversity. "Pretty aggressive outreach" by national groups. This reduced sycophancy to individual senators while potentially increasing it to WH/groups. Clinton "may have done away with those" committees but retained WH involvement. Reagan then interested "right down to the philosophy of people" - ideological litmus test replacing pure patronage. Shows evolution from local political sycophancy (senator picks) to ideological sycophancy (party orthodoxy).

### 23. Personnel Office Structure - Clusters by Department
> "I had a deputy who was more the inside guy. Then we had clusters by department. I have five or six. We had maybe as many as forty people at one time. I gather it's grown substantially since then." (p.15)

**Codes**: personnel-office-structure, cluster-system, office-expansion, harley-franklin-deputy
**Memo**: Miller's structure: deputy (inside operations), department clusters (5-6 people each handling 1-2 major departments), separate units for advisory committees, Schedule Cs, regulatory commissions. About 40 people total. Harley Franklin as deputy - "bureaucrat growing up" who had government knowledge Miller lacked. This structure enables sycophancy - centralized WH office controlling all appointments. But Miller's innovation (involving policy staff in vetting) tried to make it more collaborative.

### 24. Schedule C Problem - Destroying Credibility
> "Then there was a separate unit which I always had a problem with. It was the place where people at lower levels came through, and were referred out to departments. The trouble with that unit was that, to the extent that it was successful, it was often destroying the credibility of the Oval Office to serve as a reviewer of quality...And competence." (p.19-20)

**Codes**: schedule-c-problem, patronage-vs-quality, credibility-destruction, referral-operation-tension
**Memo**: Miller's sophisticated analysis: Schedule C referral operation (helping campaign workers find jobs) undermines Personnel Office's quality-control mission. Can't simultaneously be patron distributing favors AND merit screener ensuring competence. Miller considered moving it to DNC - "wouldn't have the force of the White House" but wouldn't "drag down on the White House staff." Reagan and Clinton expanded WH control over Schedule Cs to "some fairly low level." Structural sycophancy problem: patronage function conflicts with competence function.

### 25. Patronage Jobs Give "Less Credit and More Enemies"
> "Patronage jobs give you less credit and more enemies. You get some credit. I think the idea is building some sense of teamwork, and people identifying it. There are a lot of ways to do that that aren't done: the president and/or vice president visiting departments more; bringing people over in groups for policy briefings, having them feel more a part of a team, pictures." (p.20)

**Codes**: patronage-futility, enemies-vs-credit, teamwork-alternatives, symbolic-inclusion
**Memo**: Classic insight - patronage disappoints more than it satisfies. Better to build loyalty through: (1) presidential visits to departments, (2) policy briefings at EOB Room 450, (3) photos with president, (4) making people "feel like 'I work for this president.'" These create sycophantic attachment without job obligations. Reagan's annual Constitution Hall meeting for all appointees = smart team-building. Creates "sense of teamwork" and "people identifying" with president more effectively than individual job placements.

### 26. Carter's False Promises to Departments
> "I was thinking back to Carter, in his initial round of visits to all the departments. He talked to people about how important their work was going to be, but he led them to believe that he wasn't going to make decisions without them, that they were very critical to his decisions."
> AM: "And, then, of course, the reality—"
> MK: "And then the decisions started being made. What ends up happening is that yes, you create some friends, but you create a lot of enemies, in a way you didn't need to." (p.20)

**Codes**: false-promises, cabinet-government-rhetoric, centralization-reality, creating-enemies, expectation-violation
**Memo**: Carter promised Cabinet inclusion in decisions but then centralized anyway. Worse than never promising - creates enemies through expectation violation. Connects to earlier contempt ("little boys in short pants") - Cabinet felt deceived. Anti-sycophantic rhetoric (we'll include you) followed by sycophantic reality (defer to WH) creates worst outcome. Better to be clear about hierarchy upfront.

### 27. Rewards of White House Service
> MK: "What's the reward? You say you love it. What's the reward for it?"
> AM: "It's a sense of purpose; it's the exercise of power. There's some recognition in this town. People knew who I was and what I did. People were so excited to get a call back and I was sort of just, 'Why not?' So it was a combination of prestige, power, purpose—I don't know if there are any more P's for alliteration."
> MK: "Policy." (p.23)

**Codes**: power-prestige-purpose-rewards, recognition-in-town, excited-for-callback, white-house-attraction
**Memo**: Miller articulates what draws people to WH and creates sycophantic deference TO WH staff. People "so excited to get a call back" from him. The four P's: Power, Prestige, Purpose, Policy. This explains both (1) why people accept jobs without negotiating (awe) and (2) why others defer to WH staff. Miller found it almost comical how excited people were for his attention - "I was sort of just, 'Why not?'" Creates asymmetry enabling sycophancy toward WH.

### 28. Rejecting Bribery Attempt
> "I had somebody once come to me with—I threw them out. That happened more than once, actually. One guy came and said he had $50,000 he wanted to contribute to the campaign and I said, 'Sir, this is the White House. You want to do that at campaign headquarters on K street.'...His appointment was on my desk and I wasn't going anywhere with it. But you have to know and you have to understand where the boundaries are on stuff." (p.23)

**Codes**: refusing-corruption, boundary-maintenance, brilab-investigation, ethics-testing
**Memo**: Miller believes he was being tested - candidate turned out to be "un-indicted co-conspirator in the Brilab investigations." Multiple people tried to buy appointments. Miller's response: "you have to know and you have to understand where the boundaries are." Anti-sycophantic - maintaining professional standards despite pressure. But shows sycophancy's dark side: people assuming proximity to power can be bought. Miller unusual in his clarity about boundaries.

### 29. Defensive Operation - Talent Inventory Program Failure
> "That's not the way you assemble a government. 'Just put that over here.' I had struggles with staff who were there before I came. They wanted to go through every single resume: 'What are you wasting your time for? We've got to put together a government! You've got to get talent.'...It reminded me of pitchblende and uranium. Somehow or other he [Dick Riley] thought we were going to get to uranium by going through mountains and mountains of pitchblende...The purpose here is to put together a government, not to satisfy every single job seeker in America." (p.26)

**Codes**: talent-inventory-failure, defensive-operation, resume-mountain, proactive-recruiting, TIP-program-critique
**Memo**: Both Carter and Clinton fell into trap of processing resumes (TIP program, Clinton's computer scanning operation) rather than proactively recruiting. "You get all that stuff, you push it over to the side, and then—you go out and you pick people!" Personnel office becomes defensive, trying to respond to every applicant - "has nothing to do with what you were about." This is sycophancy to the process - letting system drive you rather than being strategic. Miller advocates aggressive talent search, not passive inbox management.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Campaign Loyalty vs. Governing Competence**: Fundamental tension between rewarding campaign team (Jordan over Watson, expectation campaign team will govern) and bringing in people with governing skills. Campaign loyalty creates automatic deference but often poor governance.

2. **Centralization Trend**: White House power centralization from LBJ/Nixon through Reagan creates structural sycophancy - all appointments must please WH personnel office. Carter's decentralization attempt failed.

3. **Battle Over Personnel Office Role**: Should it screen for "political reliability" (loyalty) or "political reliability and competence"? Duncan vs. Miller fight exemplifies core sycophancy tension. Miller lost - Carter didn't back him.

4. **Teambuilding Innovation**: Miller's use of hiring process to build genuine collaboration (involving policy staff in vetting) = anti-sycophantic. Reduces "Us vs. Them," creates relationships before people start working together.

5. **Multiple Pressures**: Personnel decisions must balance political obligations, policy goals, representation, and merit. Not pure loyalty test or pure meritocracy - sophisticated balancing act.

6. **Awe of Office**: People "awed" by WH offers accept without negotiating. Creates sycophantic acceptance of inappropriate roles. People "so excited" for callbacks from WH staff.

7. **Institutional Memory**: Reagan and Clinton staffs both initially refused to learn from predecessors - "arrogance, ignorance, adrenaline." Electoral victory creates hubris preventing learning.

8. **False Promises Problem**: Carter promised Cabinet inclusion then centralized - worse than being upfront about hierarchy. Creates enemies through expectation violation.

9. **Schedule C Dilemma**: Patronage/referral function conflicts with quality control function. Can't simultaneously distribute favors and screen for competence. Destroys credibility.

10. **Primary Process Obligations**: Modern primaries create personal presidential obligations to state-level actors, requiring larger WH staff to manage relationships. Structural driver of centralization.

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Campaign loyalty expectations (shared ordeal creates entitlement to govern)
- Primary process creating personal obligations
- Centralization trend from LBJ/Nixon onward
- Presidential personality (Clinton's need for control vs. Reagan's delegation)
- Electoral incentives to run against Washington creating staffing problems
- Awe of working in White House preventing negotiation

**Manifestations**:
- Watson work discarded for Jordan (loyalty over planning)
- "True believers" demands (Nofziger)
- "Political reliability" screening without competence
- People excited for WH callbacks
- Three loci of power (Clinton-Gore-Hillary) complicating hierarchy
- Everything sitting on Clinton's desk awaiting approval

**Consequences**:
- Much transition work wasted (Carter)
- Slow appointments (Clinton micromanagement)
- Cabinet contempt for WH ("little boys in short pants")
- Healthcare task force disaster (bypassing normal process)
- Lincoln bedroom scandal (lack of institutional appreciation)
- Need for mid-term corrections (Miller, Wexler, Strauss brought in 1978)

**Protective Factors**:
- Learning from predecessors (Miller consulting Ford, Johnson personnel directors)
- Teambuilding through hiring (involving policy staff)
- Transparent outreach with "no guarantees"
- Mature staffing (Reagan bringing in Baker unlike himself)
- Clear boundaries (Miller rejecting bribery)
- Balancing multiple forces rather than pure loyalty test
- Network-building to find talent vs. processing resumes

## Innovations and Best Practices

1. **Cluster teams**: Recruiter + policy expert + political person for each department during transition, building relationships from start
2. **No guarantees policy**: Transparent outreach to groups while maintaining merit standards
3. **Proactive recruiting**: "Go out and pick people" rather than processing inbox
4. **Learning from predecessors**: Consulting Ford and Johnson personnel directors despite party differences
5. **Balancing framework**: Political obligations + policy goals + representation + merit (ICC example)
6. **Team-building alternatives**: Policy briefings, presidential visits, photos rather than just patronage jobs
