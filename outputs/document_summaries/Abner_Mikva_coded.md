# William J. Clinton Transition - Abner Mikva Interview
**Date**: April 26, 2000
**Interviewee**: Abner Mikva (White House Counsel, 1994-1995)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar and Terry Sullivan

## Document Summary
Mikva discusses serving as White House Counsel after Lloyd Cutler, emphasizing institutional memory gaps, protecting presidential prerogatives, the 1994 partisan watershed, and surprisingly collegial staff relationships. Key themes include tribal partisan fears preventing transition continuity, Clinton's deliberative caution, imposed political deputies proving loyal, campaign finance culture clashes, and the exhausting pace for older staff. Notable for candid discussion of trying to protect prerogatives against Clinton's own willingness to give Congress everything.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Tribal Fear Between Parties
> "But there is apparently almost this tribal fear of the outgoing president that, if they leave anything to a successor of the opposite party, they'll get exposed. It's just nonsense." (p.1)

**Codes**: partisan-transition-gap, tribal-fear, institutional-memory-loss, party-distrust
**Memo**: "Tribal fear" prevents opposite-party transitions from institutional continuity. Outgoing administrations won't leave records fearing exposure by incoming opposition. Consequence: Nussbaum walked into "absolutely bare" office in January 1993. Antecedent: partisan distrust. Contrast to same-party transitions (Reagan to Bush) where continuity exists. Creates reinventing-wheel problem each transition. Sycophancy dimension: fear of disloyalty to departed president outweighs service to institution/office.

### 2. Ford Administration Thoughtfulness
> "Culvahouse and the [Gerald] Ford administration probably were the most—what's the word I'm looking for—thoughtful about their successors. Part of it was that Gerald Ford was a special kind of president. Edward Levi was a special kind of attorney general." (p.1)

**Codes**: institutional-service, ford-exceptionalism, thoughtful-succession, anti-tribal-behavior
**Memo**: Ford administration as anti-sycophantic model - thought about institutional continuity beyond their own tenure. Culvahouse left "ten books of things, including precedents, statutes." Protective factor: Ford's character ("special kind of president") and understanding there would always be future White House counsels. Service to office vs. loyalty to individual president. Contrast to tribal fear.

### 3. Never Put Anything in Writing
> "The combination of the Presidential Records Act and the fact that you just knew that the very energetic press and an even more energetic Congress make quite sure that anything that appears in writing is very likely to appear on the front page of the New York Times, some time in the future. We just never put anything in writing." (p.1)

**Codes**: defensive-documentation, scandal-avoidance, press-fear, congress-fear, operational-paralysis
**Memo**: Extreme caution driven by fear of exposure. "Never put anything in writing" = anti-sycophantic (not creating flattering record) but also governance failure (no operational continuity). Antecedent: "energetic press and even more energetic Congress." Mikva "glared" at deputy Jane Sherbourne for keeping records "that just got the White House in trouble." Protective behavior becomes institutional harm - can't pass knowledge to successors.

### 4. Executive Branch Harder Than Criticizing It
> "I learned the Executive Branch is much harder to function in than it is to criticize. As a congressman and even as a judge, it's so easy to take pot shots at how difficult it was for them to get their act together and how they couldn't organize a two-car funeral and all the other things that smart-ass congressmen say about the Executive Branch." (p.2)

**Codes**: governing-vs-criticizing, congressional-perspective, complexity-appreciation, humility
**Memo**: Learning humility about governance difficulty. "Task of trying to move 260 million people generally in the same direction is not easy." Anti-sycophancy through honesty about challenges rather than blaming/attacking. Consequence: appreciation for Clinton's caution. "The more I saw this President in action, the more relieved I was that he was cautious about things like committing our troops."

### 5. Clinton's Deliberative Caution
> "It's frustrating, even when you're there, and you try to send in a decision memo on something, on a judicial appointment or something. You send in one, but you need two. I'd send in three and they just wouldn't come back with that famous left-handed check mark that you needed to move ahead." (p.2-3)

**Codes**: decision-paralysis, deliberation, frustration, cautious-president, process-slowness
**Memo**: Clinton's extreme deliberation = protective against rash decisions but frustrating for staff. Betty Currie would say "He hasn't done it yet" by fourth time around. Not sycophancy but opposite - president won't rubber-stamp staff recommendations. "It's probably the way the Executive Branch should work." Antecedent: Clinton wanting to see every nuance. Consequence: slow decision-making but careful governance.

### 6. Elian Gonzalez Example - Presidential Restraint
> "It's fascinating watching this Elian Gonzalez thing develop. I read several columns criticizing him [President Clinton] for not exercising leadership on it. I don't know what he really should have done there... He didn't, as he shouldn't, prod [Attorney General] Janet Reno to move any faster than she did." (p.3)

**Codes**: presidential-restraint, appropriate-caution, not-interfering, respecting-boundaries
**Memo**: Anti-sycophantic governance - not prodding Reno despite pressure for "leadership." Clinton used pulpit but didn't override attorney general. "How do you come to a simple decision like: deciding when to enforce the law about who has custody of a child? It took forever and wasn't pretty when it happened." Appreciation for complexity vs. demanding quick action to please critics.

### 7. Protecting Presidential Prerogatives - Fighting the President
> "Interestingly, the biggest problems were with the President, because I think when you're occupying the office, including this one, you're just not aware of what the historical significance of what—. When you're making history, I don't think you're a very good student of history." (p.4)

**Codes**: protecting-prerogatives, institutional-memory, fighting-president, long-term-thinking
**Memo**: Anti-sycophantic role - protecting presidency against president's own short-term thinking. "When you're making history, I don't think you're a very good student of history." Presidents "going from crisis to crisis" can't judge historical significance. Mikva's job: protect prerogatives Clinton willing to give away. Role reversal - staff more concerned about institutional power than president himself.

### 8. Mexican Peso Crisis - Clinton Wanting to Give Everything to Congress
> "One day I got a call—there was kind of a code in my office. If the President wanted to see me and was in his usual good mood and would be jovial and chitchat about golf for a while, my secretary would come in and say, 'The President wants to see you.' But if it was clear that he was mad about something the message was, 'You're wanted in the Oval.'" (p.5)

**Codes**: presidential-temperament, office-codes, fear-signals, errant-schoolboys
**Memo**: Office developed codes for presidential mood - "You're wanted in the Oval" meant trouble. Mikva would "grab Panetta. It was always good to have somebody else." They'd stand "like errant schoolboys" before "this very gentle, kindly president could act like the sternest high school principal." Sycophancy antecedent: fear of presidential anger. But Mikva still stood ground on not releasing Zedillo phone call memos despite Clinton's anger.

### 9. Standing Firm on Prerogatives Despite Presidential Anger
> "He's still irritated and mad at Gingrich, and me, and Panetta. He said, 'Well, all we talked about was the weather, for crying out loud. Turn them over.' And we had to spend several minutes talking him down, to make him aware that those were not documents that should be disclosed. So we didn't." (p.5)

**Codes**: speaking-truth-to-power, protecting-prerogatives, resisting-president, institutional-thinking
**Memo**: Anti-sycophantic behavior - saying no to angry president. Clinton wanted to release Zedillo call memos to avoid "stonewalling" accusation. Mikva/Panetta had to "talk him down" - explain foreign head of state shouldn't be quoted in newspapers. Won this battle. Protective factor: understanding long-term institutional harm vs. short-term political benefit. Clinton operated on premise "if Congress really wanted anything, you have to give to them."

### 10. 1994 Election Watershed
> "I think that the 1994 election was the watershed in terms of the Congress really turning into a partisan brawl. Up through the 1994 election, there were still some relationships between Democrats and Republicans. They got on with each other, worked together. After the 1994 election, it was perceived as a battleground and worked out that way." (p.6)

**Codes**: partisan-watershed, 1994-election, relationship-breakdown, battleground-mentality
**Memo**: 1994 as turning point from cooperation to warfare. Before: "still some relationships between Democrats and Republicans." After: "perceived as a battleground." Antecedent: Republican takeover of House. Consequence: even longtime friends like Henry Hyde saying "I don't run this agenda" when Mikva sought cooperation. "Shell-shocked" White House. President "went into a state of shock for some time." Structural change enabling more aggressive sycophancy to party/base vs. bipartisan governance.

### 11. Political Process for Nominations - Not Pejorative
> "You have to understand, when I use the word political process I don't use it in pejorative terms. I consider it the way the system is supposed to work. But there were some that would come in directly through the political process. The primary movers were people who had been helpful to the President in California or Florida, or whatever, and that, 'He would be a great judge, you've really got to help him.'" (p.7)

**Codes**: political-process-defense, patronage-logic, system-working, loyalty-rewards
**Memo**: Mikva defends "political process" as legitimate, not corrupt. Judges lobby - "Nobody stands for public office in this country, not even a district judge, to be elevated. He's got to put on a campaign." Campaign = "getting all kinds of phone calls into every place that's in the loop." But distinction: political pressure for those "helpful to the President" = potential sycophancy (rewarding loyalty over merit). Mikva notes Clinton made "fewer bad appointments at the bench than any president in history" - suggesting political process controlled by merit concerns.

### 12. McCurry as Straight Shooter
> "That's the difference in the way Mike McCurry ran the Press Office compared to his successors or his predecessors. I don't think it was just me. I think that the press genuinely trusted him. They felt that he was a straight shooter and wasn't going to look for ways to make their job hard. And, even during the height of the [Lewinsky] scandal while he was there, he never lied to them." (p.7)

**Codes**: straight-shooter-credibility, press-trust, anti-manipulation, professional-integrity
**Memo**: McCurry's anti-sycophantic approach with press. "Never lied to them. He never sent them off in the wrong direction." Consequence: "they didn't barrel him. Nobody was giving free passes to William Jefferson Clinton, but they didn't use the Press Secretary as a way of beating up on the President." Contrast to predecessors where press attacked press secretary. Protective factor: professional integrity over political spin. Service without servility.

### 13. Dee Dee Myers Losing Client Confidence
> "The other thing is that, early on, she lost the confidence of her client and then it really gets—whereas with McCurry even when the President might wish he'd use up a few of his chits, there was nothing other than great admiration for the professional he was." (p.8)

**Codes**: client-confidence, competence-crisis, wrong-person-wrong-job, campaign-vs-governing
**Memo**: Myers as wrong fit - campaign experience insufficient for White House. "Wrong person in the wrong job. She didn't have the kind of experience that it takes to be a spokesperson for the President." Consequence: lost "confidence of her client" = sycophancy death spiral (can't serve effectively if president doesn't trust). Contrast to McCurry who maintained confidence even when using "chits." Antecedent: campaign skills ≠ governing skills.

### 14. Freeh Shooting Down Civil Liberties Concerns
> "Freeh was bound and determined to get something through. I remember we had a big meeting in the Situation Room. Tony Lake probably presided, because there were national security implications. Merrick Garland—who was then number three in Justice—and I were the only two who were trying to resist what we considered excesses in the bill. Freeh just shot us down. I think at that point the President was prepared to go wherever his advisers ended up." (p.9)

**Codes**: bureaucratic-steamrolling, policy-defeat, outnumbered-resistance, presidential-deference
**Memo**: Mikva and Garland alone resisting Terrorism Act excesses. Freeh "shot us down." Clinton "prepared to go wherever his advisers ended up" - not sycophancy but deference to majority view. Consequence: Mikva's civil liberties concerns overridden. "We sometimes move—not on the facts, but the appearance of facts" (TWA plane, Oklahoma bombing). Antecedent: crisis atmosphere, FBI Director's bureaucratic power. Shows limits of counsel's influence when outnumbered.

### 15. Haiti Decision - Wanting Exit Strategy
> "I still remember when he finally came to closure on Haiti, that the thing that he had resisted all along was not that we need to do something—if you recall the boats sinking off the Florida shore and we didn't have any place to put anybody—but he just wanted to make sure we had some kind of an exit policy. He didn't see it turning into an instant success." (p.10)

**Codes**: exit-strategy, vietnam-lessons, cautious-intervention, restraint
**Memo**: Clinton's caution as protective against sycophantic pressure for action. "He remembers the politics of Vietnam much better than a lot of people who are younger than he is, or a lot of his predecessors." Wanted exit strategy before intervention despite pressure. Antecedent: Vietnam experience. Protective factor: historical memory. "This President does exercise great restraint, sometimes to the point where we look like this helpless giant we're accused of being."

### 16. Bruce Lindsay as Imposed Deputy - Initial Resistance
> "About two days before I started, Panetta said, 'By the way, Bruce Lindsay's going to be your deputy.' At that point that was as close as I came to leaving in a huff. I didn't know Bruce that well. I knew him slightly. I thought, 'This isn't going to work. I don't want a political deputy who is going to undercut my decisions, who is going to be somebody everybody else on the staff can run to. When they don't like what I tell them, they'll go get it countermanded by Bruce.'" (p.11)

**Codes**: imposed-deputy, political-oversight, trust-issues, potential-undermining
**Memo**: Lindsay as potential sycophantic plant - political watchdog to countermand counsel. Mikva nearly "leaving in a huff" over broken promise of no interference. President "insists he wants Bruce there—not to watch you but because that's a good place for Bruce." Mollified by getting second deputy of his own choice. Antecedent: president wanting loyalist in counsel's office. But outcome: anti-sycophancy triumph...

### 17. Bruce Lindsay Proves Loyal to Office Not Politics
> "But I have to say that I could not have asked for a more loyal deputy than Bruce Lindsay. When they came to him, and they did, he said, 'If that's what Ab said, that's it.' If they went over his head, they went to the President." (p.11)

**Codes**: loyalty-to-office, anti-sycophancy-surprise, integrity-over-politics, role-clarity
**Memo**: Lindsay surprised Mikva by being loyal to office/counsel rather than to political interests. When staff tried to get Lindsay to countermand Mikva: "If that's what Ab said, that's it." Anti-sycophantic behavior - supported counsel's professional judgment over political pressure. Protective factor: clear understanding of role boundaries. Shows imposed deputy structure can work if deputy has integrity. Contrast to expected sycophantic behavior.

### 18. Lindsay's Role - Presidential Connection Without Violation
> "He always felt that—he helped us shape the agenda about things that we were doing, by making us more aware of what it was that was on the President's plate, and what we needed to know about where the President was going on something. He never violated confidences of the President." (p.12)

**Codes**: bounded-loyalty, appropriate-information-sharing, dual-loyalty-management, professional-boundaries
**Memo**: Lindsay managed dual loyalty skillfully. Made counsel's office aware of president's priorities without violating confidences. "What do we know about strike-breaking?" when executive order coming. Anti-sycophantic balance: serving president's interests by ensuring counsel informed, not by undermining counsel's judgment. Role: "make sure that when there was a political process nominee, that the political process was being observed."

### 19. Campaign Finance Culture Clash
> "I think this government came into the White House not very sensitive to the fact that the White House and the Federal government is a different place. So I should have warned the President. I should have recognized this was troublesome. I never would have thought to say anything to the Vice President, because he came off the Hill. I would have thought that he'd remembered. We never used our offices for any of those things. We all had bucket shops down the street." (p.13-14)

**Codes**: state-vs-federal-norms, culture-clash, failure-to-warn, insensitivity, campaign-finance
**Memo**: Arkansas/state politics culture (governors fundraise from office) clashed with federal norms. Mikva's failure: "I should have warned the President." Assumed Gore would remember Hill rules but "even a smart political animal like Phil Burton understood that you don't get involved in fund-raising or the trappings of fund-raising in a Federal building." Consequence: campaign finance scandals. Antecedent: different political cultures (state vs. federal). Mikva accepts blame: "none of us saw fit to raise a warning flag."

### 20. Presidents Want to Please People
> "Really, by their nature, presidents are politicians, and politicians want to please people. TG: And they compromise all the time. MK: Yes. TG: You're in here. I'll tell you what you want to hear, because then I can go over here and tell somebody something else; the likelihood that you ever connect the dots is pretty slim." (p.17, note: TG attribution appears to be error - should be AM)

**Codes**: presidential-nature, pleasing-people, compartmentalization, political-instinct
**Memo**: Presidents' natural inclination to please creates sycophancy-enabling environment. Tell each person what they want to hear, assume they won't "connect the dots." Not sycophancy itself but explains why sycophants succeed - president rewards what pleases him. "A lot of them are not good personnel people; they don't like to have to make those choices." Antecedent: political survival skills. Consequence: enables staff sycophancy, difficulty making hard personnel decisions.

### 21. Physical Exhaustion and Age
> "I was the oldest person in the White House. I came in at sixty-nine and I was actually seventy by the time I left, and the physical schedule was just more than I could handle. I would come in at six-thirty in the morning and leave at nine at night. I was the first one out of the White House! They were all still doing scheduling meetings and all kinds of things." (p.17)

**Codes**: age-limits, exhaustion, unsustainable-pace, physical-demands, youth-preference
**Memo**: White House culture values youth, stamina, extreme hours. Mikva "first one out" at 9pm when others still working. "Never served a president younger than I was." Walked out with pneumonia. Consequence: counsel position needs younger person who can maintain pace. No sycophancy dimension directly, but hours-competition culture (performative overwork) from other interviews present here. "I should have done that twenty years ago, not at sixty-nine."

### 22. Collegial Relationships - Less Backstabbing Than Expected
> "I found the relationships in the White House very collegial. People really got along with each other. I got along with them. I found there was very little back-stabbing and knife-throwing, and not nearly as much as I expected to believe there was." (p.18)

**Codes**: collegial-culture, low-backstabbing, positive-relationships, surprising-cooperation
**Memo**: Clinton White House more collegial than expected. "With really one exception, maybe two, I found the relationships in the White House very collegial." Anti-sycophancy indicator: genuine cooperation rather than competitive deference to president. Stephanopoulos: "I found him interesting and creative. Now, I can see where some people could have found him abrasive." Harold Ickes: "his share of idiosyncrasies, but if I were president of the United States, I'd sure want somebody like Harold Ickes." Appreciating competence and effectiveness over agreeableness.

### 23. Congress as Legislative Branch Most Powerful
> "I am probably more a creature of the Congress than anything else, but I think that's partly because it was my first real exposure to government, and partly because I spent more time in it than any place else—state and Federal—and partly because it really is—of all the branches of government—in many respects the most powerful." (p.18)

**Codes**: branch-comparison, congressional-power, creativity-culture, institutional-differences
**Memo**: Congress as empowering institution - "creativity is a plus. You're expected to come up with new ideas. If most of them are bad, it doesn't matter. You take another alley." Contrast to Executive: "think time" limited, crisis-driven. White House "exciting" but exhausting. Judicial: "lots of think time on the court." Different branches enable/resist sycophancy differently. Congress: individual power, can oppose leadership. Executive: hierarchical, president-focused. Court: peer review, precedent-bound.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Tribal Partisan Fear**: Opposite-party transitions lose institutional memory from fear of exposing predecessors
2. **Protecting President From Himself**: Counsel fighting president to preserve prerogatives Clinton willing to give away
3. **Imposed Deputy Proving Loyal**: Bruce Lindsay expected to be political watchdog but supported counsel's judgment
4. **1994 Partisan Watershed**: Election transformed Congress from cooperation to "battleground"
5. **Campaign Finance Culture Clash**: State politics norms (fundraising from office) inappropriate for federal level
6. **Presidential Nature to Please**: Politicians tell people what they want to hear, enabling sycophancy
7. **McCurry's Straight Shooting**: Never lying to press built trust, prevented attacks
8. **Physical Exhaustion Culture**: Extreme hours as expectation, age as liability
9. **Collegial Not Backstabbing**: Less competitive sycophancy than expected in Clinton White House
10. **Presidents as Poor Historians**: Making history makes you bad student of it, need staff to protect long-term interests

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Partisan tribal fear preventing institutional continuity
- Presidential Records Act creating extreme caution about documentation
- 1994 election creating partisan battleground
- State political culture different from federal norms
- Presidential nature to want to please people
- Physical demands favoring youth over experience
- Campaign vs. governing skill differences (Myers)

**Manifestations**:
- Never putting anything in writing to avoid exposure
- Office codes for presidential moods ("You're wanted in the Oval")
- Standing "like errant schoolboys" before angry president
- Political process for nominations (lobbying campaigns)
- Imposed political deputy (Lindsay) to watch counsel
- Presidents telling people what they want to hear

**Consequences**:
- No operational records for successors (bare office for Nussbaum)
- Clinton willing to give away prerogatives to avoid "stonewalling" accusation
- Myers losing client confidence, effectiveness collapse
- Campaign finance scandals from cultural insensitivity
- Civil liberties concerns overridden by Freeh/security pressure
- Exhaustion and burnout (Mikva with pneumonia)

**Protective Factors**:
- Ford administration's thoughtful transition preparation (Culvahouse)
- Mikva/Panetta standing firm against angry Clinton on Zedillo memos
- Bruce Lindsay supporting counsel despite political pressure
- McCurry's straight shooting building press trust
- Collegial relationships preventing backstabbing competition
- Mikva's congressional experience providing perspective
- Understanding Executive Branch complexity (humility)
- Accepting blame for failures (campaign finance warning)

**Anti-Sycophancy Examples**:
- Mikva nearly leaving over imposed Lindsay deputy (defending autonomy)
- Talking Clinton down from releasing documents to Congress
- Resisting Freeh's anti-civil liberties measures (even though lost)
- McCurry never lying to press despite scandal pressure
- Lindsay saying "If that's what Ab said, that's it" when pressured
- Mikva accepting blame: "I should have warned the President"
- Appreciation for competence (Ickes, Stephanopoulos) over agreeableness
- Leaving when physically exhausted rather than continuing ineffectively

**Sycophancy-Enabling Factors**:
- Tribal fear making loyalty to departed president > service to institution
- Extreme caution about documentation preventing honest assessment
- Presidential anger creating office codes, "errant schoolboy" dynamic
- Political process legitimizing loyalty-based appointments
- President's nature to please enabling staff who tell him what he wants
- Youth/stamina culture privileging performative overwork
- Campaign loyalists expecting rewards, bringing incompatible cultural norms
