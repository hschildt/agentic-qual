# Jimmy Carter Transition - Mark Siegel Interview
**Date**: January 4, 2000
**Interviewee**: Mark Siegel (Deputy to Hamilton Jordan)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Siegel discusses his role as one of Hamilton Jordan's three deputies, focusing on Cabinet selection, political operations, and his eventual resignation over policy disagreement. Key themes include the Watson-Jordan power struggle, Carter's structural response to Watergate through diffused power, loyalty vs. competence tensions in personnel selection, and the consequences of principled dissent.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. First Day Chaos - No One to Convene Meeting
> "The first day that we were in the White House...President Carter, for very interesting reasons, did not designate a chief of staff. It was his structural response to Watergate. He was convinced that Watergate was a product of concentration of power, so he was going to diffuse power. He was going to diffuse it by not having a chief of staff. So, when we all got in to the Roosevelt Room and sat down, there was literally no one to convene the meeting. You can only imagine sitting around this table. It's four o'clock; we're all really new and very excited. It's four; it's four-oh-one; it's four-oh-two. People are coughing. Literally, there is no one to convene the meeting." (p.2)

**Codes**: organizational-chaos, no-chief-of-staff, watergate-response, diffused-power-dysfunction
**Memo**: Literal manifestation of organizational dysfunction from anti-hierarchical structure. Carter's attempt to avoid sycophancy-enabling hierarchy created paralysis - nobody could even start a meeting. Antecedent: fear of Haldeman/Ehrlichman model. Consequence: immediate operational problems.

### 2. Watson vs. Jordan - Formal vs. Real Power
> "I don't want to sound arrogant and dismissive here—Jack is a very nice guy and a friend of mine—but what Jack thought and what Jack wrote was totally irrelevant to this process, because, although he was designated the formal head of transition, he wasn't. It goes back to that Animal Farm thing. Everyone knew that [it was] Jordan and his cadre of four or five people...they, in fact, were selecting the Cabinet and they, in fact, were selecting White House staff. So Jack had the big office. Jordan, interestingly enough, didn't have an office at transition." (p.3)

**Codes**: formal-vs-real-power, animal-farm-equality, watson-jordan-rivalry, organizational-deception
**Memo**: Classic example of sycophancy dynamics - understanding who really has power vs. formal titles. Staff must figure out whom to defer to. Jordan deliberately hid during transition ("no one could ever find him") while Watson had ceremonial role. Consequence: confusion about authority, wasted effort deferring to wrong person.

### 3. Cheney's Spokes-of-Wheel Warning
> "I had told Dick Cheney the structure, which was to have eight assistants to the President with equal access to the President. He rolled his eyes into his head and he went into his closet and he pulled out this bicycle wheel. Do you know this story?...It's all gnarled and everything. He said, 'Take this back and show it to the President-elect and tell him this is the spokes-of-the-wheel theory of equal access to the President.' It was really quite funny. And Jordan concurred but, again, Jimmy was convinced that Watergate was a product of the centralization and corruption of power into the hands of [John] Ehrlichman and [H. R.] Haldeman, and he was going to have equal access, and be his own chief of staff." (p.2)

**Codes**: spokes-of-wheel-failure, watergate-overreaction, anti-hierarchy-dysfunction, cheney-warning
**Memo**: Cheney's graphic warning (literal gnarled bicycle wheel!) about organizational model designed to prevent sycophancy. Antecedent: Watergate creating fear of hierarchy. Carter's anti-sycophantic structure (equal access) proved unworkable. Jordan "concurred" but Carter overruled. Eventual consequence: had to adopt chief of staff model after 2 years.

### 4. Jordan's De Facto Power - "Some Animals More Equal"
> "That all disintegrated. After two years, Hamilton did become the formal chief of staff. In fact, from the very beginning he was the de facto chief of staff because, like Animal Farm, all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal. Well, that animal - being Hamilton Jordan - was seen as more equal because he had the relationship with the president. So, even though he didn't have the formal title, he had the power." (p.2)

**Codes**: de-facto-hierarchy, animal-farm-inequality, relationship-power, informal-sycophancy
**Memo**: Despite formal equal-access structure, sycophantic hierarchy emerged based on personal relationships. Staff quickly learned Jordan was "more equal" - had to defer to him regardless of org chart. This is inevitable sycophancy: concentration of power in single person (president) necessitates hierarchy, which enables/requires sycophantic behavior.

### 5. Affirmative Action as Quota - "Boxes Missing"
> "It also got a little annoying, in terms of affirmative action kinds of pressures. Worst-case scenario, but affirmative action were quotas. You fill out everything and there were a few boxes missing and you say, not: 'Who's the best person to fill those boxes?', but, 'Who's the best person with: color, or gender, or this, or that, to fill these boxes?' If you're really short, it has to be a triple or quadruple. It came down to that on Cabinet, too." (p.3)

**Codes**: quota-filling, competence-secondary, diversity-pressure, pat-harris-example
**Memo**: Selection driven by identity categories rather than merit. Creates environment where sycophants can be selected if they check demographic boxes. Consequence: poor performers like Costanza. Pat Harris got HUD because "we were a woman short and a black short."

### 6. Power of Transition Position - "All of a Sudden You're a Sir"
> "That was the first time that one realizes the new power. You're an official of a party out of power and suddenly you're calling people as part of a transition [and] the response at the other end is so extraordinary. 'Me, what?' All of a sudden you're a 'Sir'." (p.3)

**Codes**: power-realization, deference-experience, sir-title, transition-authority
**Memo**: Siegel's visceral experience of becoming recipient of sycophantic behavior. Simply being on transition team (proximity to power) triggered automatic deference - "all of a sudden you're a Sir." This is manifestation of sycophancy - people respond to position/access, not person.

### 7. Henry Mayer Interview - Destroying Competition
> "Henry Mayer, who was the mayor, knew he was being considered for - he assumed Secretary of either HUD or HHS. 'What could it be?' He was a mayor. And then I'm suddenly calling him about the governor, whom he despised, [about] the same job! Suddenly he's the competition. He used the interview to really try to destroy the governor...And Mayer just destroyed the governor, and the governor only praised Henry Mayer. I went into Hamilton and said, 'This is a wonderful little anecdote for history, Hamilton.' He said, 'Let me give you another part of the anecdote', and he took the Henry Mayer file and ripped it in half and threw it in the garbage." (p.5)

**Codes**: competition-destroys-rival, anti-sycophantic-graciousness, character-test, instant-disqualification
**Memo**: Perfect natural experiment in sycophancy! Both competing for same job. Mayer (sycophant) tried to destroy competitor; Governor Lucey (principled) was gracious despite competition. Jordan immediately disqualified Mayer - demonstrated he couldn't be trusted. Anti-sycophantic behavior (Lucey's graciousness) rewarded. Shows importance of character over tactical positioning.

### 8. Anne Wexler "Too Good" - Threat to Georgian Insiders
> "This was a group of Georgians that were still quite contemptuous of Washington, and the Washington power circle, and the Washington élite, and business as usual. They had no institutional memory and, in fact, they didn't want any institutional memory, because they're going to do it differently...He never told me why Anne Wexler didn't get that job, but I knew from talking to him that he had no intention of giving Anne Wexler that job. I think it was because she was too good and she was too connected. She had that gravitas that no one else in the circle—Frank Moore and—. Jody was different, because he was a press guy...But certainly Hamilton didn't have it. No one knew who Jack [Watson] was. So if she had joined the senior staff as assistant to the President for public liaison, establishment Washington would have had this: 'Aha! There it is! That's our way in, that's our route in!' Hamilton Jordan didn't want any part of it, and gave her a position I think she was overqualified for." (p.6)

**Codes**: too-competent-threat, washington-establishment-contempt, no-institutional-memory, georgia-mafia-insecurity, competence-punished
**Memo**: CRITICAL EXCERPT on anti-sycophancy being punished! Wexler too competent, too connected = threat to Georgian insiders who lacked her gravitas. Jordan deliberately blocked her from appropriate position because she would outshine them and give "establishment Washington" their route in. Antecedent: outsider insecurity. Manifestation: selecting less competent loyalist (Costanza) over more competent outsider. Consequence: organizational ineffectiveness (Costanza failure, later need to bring Wexler in to fix things).

### 9. Midge Costanza - Loyalty Without Qualifications
> "If he wanted a woman for that public liaison position, he could have picked any woman in the world, and he picked Midge. Now, of course, Midge was a loyalist; she was an early Carter person, but there was nothing in her background to suggest she could do this job." (p.6)

**Codes**: loyalty-over-competence, unqualified-selection, early-supporter-reward, costanza-failure
**Memo**: Explicit statement that Costanza selected for loyalty ("early Carter person") despite zero qualifications. Consequence: "Midge was very cavalier about her job; she wasn't serious...wasn't really serious about it...no gravitas." Had to fire her in 1978 massacre and bring in Wexler to fix it. Classic sycophantic dynamic: reward loyalists regardless of merit, suffer consequences.

### 10. Cabinet Autonomy Creating Disloyalty
> "Jimmy Carter...believed the same thing about the Cabinet. He wanted the cabinet not to be reporting to his staff. He wanted the Cabinet secretaries to be very much on their own in terms of policy, in terms of personnel. It's a White House staff nightmare: 'You're taking everything away from us!'...when he would ask a Califano or a Vance to become secretary, he made it clear...'I don't want you to suffer any interference from my staff. I trust you. I'm putting my confidence in you. You pick the best people….'" (p.7)

**Codes**: cabinet-autonomy, anti-coordination, trust-without-oversight, cabinet-government-mistake
**Memo**: Carter's anti-sycophantic principle (trusting Cabinet, no White House interference) backfired spectacularly. Gave away authority to Cabinet secretaries who then didn't feel they worked for president. Consequence: multiple voices, no coordination, Cabinet bringing in people disloyal to Carter.

### 11. Califano Defiance - False Compliance
> "I had one incident with Califano. Califano selected a guy named John Ellis to be Commissioner of Education. I was in the White House at that point, and I was in charge of political checks. And I find out he was a Republican; he had supported Ford; he was hated by the Ohio educational association. Despised! He had been sued by the NAACP...President said, 'Joe, you've recommended this guy and I know I told you that you could do your own staffing, but I think you should be aware of what I think belongs in this administration.' He went into all these things; everything is, 'No, no, no, no, no. I don't think this guy should be in this administration.' And then he said, 'Of course, I will rely on your judgment now that you know how strongly I feel about this.' And Mr. Califano allegedly said, 'Thank you, Mr. President, for sharing your views with me, but I have confidence in him and I'm going to go ahead with this appointment.' And the President said, 'Okay.' And the word went forth from this time and place, different. When that permeated, and it did, everyone knew you could bring in the worst kind of comedian, politically, and get him on. It certainly diminishes staff." (p.7)

**Codes**: false-compliance, cabinet-defiance, authority-undermined, diminished-staff, political-disloyalty
**Memo**: INCREDIBLE EXAMPLE of anti-sycophancy gone wrong! Califano performed surface compliance ("thank you for sharing your views") while completely defying Carter's explicit wishes. Carter allowed it despite laying out all the problems. Consequence: "everyone knew you could bring in the worst kind" - complete loss of personnel control. This is failure of authority - Carter couldn't demand loyalty because he'd promised autonomy. Result: administration filled with people disloyal to Carter, staff demoralized.

### 12. Vance Grudge Over Forced Appointment
> "The President only countered that position once, and that was with Vance...The President said, 'Well, I want Joe Duffy to have this position.' It was extraordinary, because Vance never forgot it. When they did the State Department reorganization that year, he reorganized ECA, Education and Cultural Affairs, and gave it to USIA—because he wanted the assistant secretary out. It's unusual to give away power. Education and Cultural Affairs, the Fulbright program, the exchange program. It's good sexy stuff. He just gave it all over to USIA, because of the deal that was betrayed. And he wanted his own team." (p.7-8)

**Codes**: grudge-holding, passive-aggressive-retaliation, deal-betrayal, vance-resentment
**Memo**: Vance never forgave Carter for forcing one appointment, even though Carter gave autonomy on everything else. Retaliated by giving away entire powerful division just to get rid of that one person. Shows how Cabinet secretaries saw loyalty as horizontal (to their own teams) not vertical (to president). Consequence of Carter's cabinet government: secretaries acted independently, even vengefully.

### 13. Rick Hutchinson Selection - Controlling Paper = Controlling Presidency
> "Well, the Staff Secretary I think is quite interesting, because we selected a very young kid, Rick Hutchinson...Improbable, to say the least, for that position...Hamilton is a very smart guy, and he understood and we discussed that he would control the paper and control the presidency. He would control the paper in the Oval Office, controlled everything. And why he selected this—Rick, at that point, was a baby." (p.15)

**Codes**: paper-control-equals-power, inexperienced-selection, staff-secretary-strategic, jordan-control-mechanism
**Memo**: Jordan understood that controlling paper flow = controlling presidency, so selected very junior person for Staff Secretary - someone he could control. This is strategic use of sycophancy - putting malleable person in key position. Antecedent: understanding power dynamics. Manifestation: selecting inexperienced subordinate for critical role. Consequence: Jordan maintained de facto chief of staff power despite lack of title.

### 14. Siegel's Background - Washington Establishment Embodiment
> "I had to be very careful, because I knew how they felt about the Washington establishment, and I embodied it. Executive Director; close to labor, close to the Jewish community, academic, liberal, friend of Kennedy, a Humphrey Democrat. All—...That's about five or six flags there." (p.15)

**Codes**: washington-establishment-suspect, kennedy-connection-liability, insider-distrust, georgia-mafia-contempt
**Memo**: Siegel acutely aware he represented everything Georgian insiders distrusted. Had to be "very careful" - couldn't push for positions despite qualifications. This is anti-sycophantic environment paradoxically creating different sycophancy: insiders (less qualified) preferred over establishment figures (more qualified) based on loyalty/outsider status.

### 15. Public Liaison Gender-Specific Position
> "I also don't understand Public Liaison. What is it about it that makes it gender specific?...once it had a woman and then had a second woman...then it became difficult to have a man." (p.15-16)

**Codes**: gender-specific-position, affirmative-action-trap, showcase-position, token-slot
**Memo**: Once position filled by woman, became "woman's position" - limiting pool. This is consequence of quota thinking rather than merit-based selection. Creates expectation that position serves symbolic rather than substantive function.

### 16. Job Description and Paper Role
> "he described this job as his political deputy in the White House. He said, 'You've worked very hard for this party. This is your chance to keep the party going. You'd be in charge of the Democratic National Committee; you'd be the liaison with the state parties. You'd be in charge of all the patronage positions and political checks.' But then he said, 'We also want'—this is going back to the paper thing; you'll find this fascinating. He said, 'When the paper goes in to the President, I want someone—in this case you—to have a notation laying out for the President the various political implications of his policy options.'" (p.18)

**Codes**: paper-control, political-implications-notation, jordan-control-mechanism, access-to-president
**Memo**: Siegel's role included annotating all paper going to president with political implications. This is mechanism for Jordan to maintain control - his deputy's views on every paper. Shows how chief of staff role functions even without title - controlling information flow to president.

### 17. Carter's Work-Life Balance - "Most Important Job"
> "I went to speak to the President-elect about that. I said, 'I know I'm going to have to work day and night, but I want to be home with my kids and put them to bed. Then I'll come back; I'll work as long as I have to.' And he said, 'You work seven in the morning until seven at night. No one can expect more of you.'...Carter was wonderful that way, just the opposite of the Clinton presidency where those people stay in the White House five minutes later than the person in the next office; midnight, twelve-oh-five, one a.m. It doesn't make any difference." (p.18)

**Codes**: carter-work-hours-reasonable, clinton-hours-competition, performative-overwork, insecurity-hours
**Memo**: Carter explicitly said work-life balance important. Contrast with Clinton WH where staff competed on hours - classic sycophantic performance! "Stay five minutes later than person in next office" to signal loyalty/commitment. Antecedent: job insecurity. Manifestation: performative overwork. Consequence: burnout, disconnection from normal life.

### 18. Clinton Staff Living in White House
> "And the attitude in the first two years, when I was there, I thought I was in a fraternity dormitory or something. They would live there; their clothes were there; [inaudible] was there. And I thought it was very sad. The ones who were married said they didn't recognize their children anymore." (p.18)

**Codes**: living-at-white-house, extreme-hours, family-neglect, clinton-culture
**Memo**: Clinton staff literally living in WH - ultimate sycophantic performance of commitment. Consequence: "didn't recognize their children anymore." This is pathological manifestation of loyalty performance culture.

### 19. Hours as Insecurity Performance
> "I don't think that the people who work fifteen and sixteen hours really have to; they just think it's part of the definition of the job...And they're very insecure. They want the word to go to the president: they work harder than anybody else." (p.19)

**Codes**: hours-as-performance, insecurity-driving-hours, presidential-approval-seeking, performative-loyalty
**Memo**: Siegel identifies hours as sycophantic performance driven by insecurity. Don't actually need to work 15-16 hours but want president to hear "they work harder than anybody else." Antecedent: job insecurity. Manifestation: performative overwork. Consequence: ineffectiveness, burnout.

### 20. Only Three Bulletproof People
> "One person was saying that he thought that, while time is often discussed as a big problem, that it's not time: it's job insecurity. And it was a person from the Carter White House. He said there were only four people who were bullet-proof, or was it three. He said it was Jordan, Powell and [Stu] Eizenstat. There were, I guess, just three...Otherwise it was job insecurity, and you knew that people were after you, in one way or another. That, he said, was really wearing. That people would leak information when there was a disaster, and they would try to cover themselves." (p.19)

**Codes**: job-insecurity, bulletproof-status, three-protected, leaking-to-cover, open-season-culture
**Memo**: Only 3 people protected from firing - everyone else vulnerable. Consequence: staff leaked to cover themselves when disasters happened, creating atmosphere of distrust and self-protection rather than teamwork. Antecedent: lack of chief of staff creating unclear authority. Manifestation: defensive backstabbing. This drives sycophantic behavior - must constantly prove loyalty/value.

### 21. White House as "Snake Pit"
> "In fact, one person I talked to had worked in an executive branch agency and he also had worked in the Congress and he found the environment in the White House the most difficult of all of them. One of them said that the White House was a snake pit from his view point, of people backbiting." (p.19-20)

**Codes**: snake-pit, backbiting, white-house-culture, lateral-hostility
**Memo**: White House environment worst of all government settings - "snake pit of people backbiting." This is consequence of job insecurity + proximity to power + unclear hierarchy. Creates environment where staff must engage in sycophantic upward deference while engaging in lateral backstabbing.

### 22. Carter's Micro-Managing - Circling Typos
> "They both started off as being micro-managers. Jimmy stayed a micro-manager. My letter of resignation, which was a very strong policy dissent, came back to me from the President with a typo circled. It didn't speak to any of the issues." (p.14)

**Codes**: micromanaging, missing-point, typo-circled, resignation-letter, detail-obsession
**Memo**: Perfect example of micromanaging missing forest for trees. Siegel's policy resignation letter (major event) returned with typo circled, no response to substance. Shows Carter's inability to delegate, need to control minutiae. Creates sycophantic environment - staff must ensure perfect formatting, punctuation, etc. rather than focusing on substance.

### 23. Rosalynn's Watchdog Role - Swimming Pool Story
> "She was very, I thought, cold and unsmiling, but it was very disconcerting because she would enter and exit policy discussions at her will and sit down in the back of a room with her notepad and start taking notes...With Rosalynn, it was like a bed check; you felt like you were being watched and observed. She would never say anything...I had to ask the President of the United States if I could use the swimming pool...And he said he would have to ask Rosalynn. A couple of days later...he came over to me and said, 'I asked Rosalynn and she said No.' I said, 'Well, it's your swimming pool, Mr. President. But I'm just curious. Why?' And he said, 'Because Amy uses the swimming pool.'" (p.23)

**Codes**: rosalynn-watchdog, bed-check-culture, swimming-pool-micromanaging, first-lady-enforcement
**Memo**: Rosalynn as enforcer/observer creating surveillance atmosphere - "bed check." Swimming pool story epitomizes micromanaging culture - president has to ask First Lady about staff using pool, three or four discussions about "something totally inane." Creates environment where staff feels constantly watched, must seek permission for trivial matters. Sycophantic manifestation: must defer even on personal recreational activities.

### 24. Clinton Young People - Insecure and Status-Seeking
> "There was a tendency in this [Clinton] administration to bring in very, very young people who had not had jobs, literally, outside of college. They went from college to the campaign and into this administration. This has been true of Clinton always: Clinton in some ways is very insecure. He doesn't have people in the White House who are senior to him." (p.20)

**Codes**: young-inexperienced-staff, clinton-insecurity, no-senior-advisers, college-to-white-house
**Memo**: Clinton selected young, inexperienced people with no outside jobs - maximally vulnerable to sycophantic dynamics. Antecedent: Clinton's insecurity - didn't want people senior to him. Consequence: staff who don't know how to maintain boundaries, work reasonable hours, or push back. Perfect environment for pathological loyalty.

### 25. Clinton's Selective Temper - Deferential to Seniors
> "It's abusive; it's sort of an authoritarian personality. It's abusive, it's psychically violent; it's almost physically violent. It's obscene; it's profane. But I can see it. You can talk to George Stephanopoulos about it. When you go through it, it's searing because it's so humiliating, and then, even as you're going through it, you're thinking: 'He doesn't mean this; in fifteen minutes he's not even going to remember that this happened.' It's like an alcoholic blackout or something. But I've heard that it doesn't happen when he's deferential to people, and he knows he can turn it on and turn it off." (p.20)

**Codes**: clinton-temper, abusive-to-juniors, deferential-to-seniors, calculated-abuse, humiliation
**Memo**: Clinton could "turn on and turn off" abusive temper - directed at young vulnerable staff, never at seniors like Cutler who "never seen his temper." This is exploitation of sycophantic power dynamic. Young staff must absorb abuse, rationalize it ("he doesn't mean it"), and continue serving. Consequence: humiliation, psychological damage, but staff stay because of insecurity and ambition.

### 26. No One Quit Over Clinton Scandal
> "I'm surprised that people didn't quit. I'm surprised, particularly, that women in the administration didn't quit, that fathers of twenty-year-old women didn't quit, or just people who thought that the lying was unconscionable. Forget the act." (p.20-21)

**Codes**: no-resignations, loyalty-over-principle, lying-tolerated, clinton-scandal
**Memo**: Siegel (who resigned on principle) shocked no one quit over Clinton scandal. Shows how sycophantic culture makes principle-based resignation unthinkable - loyalty paramount. McCurry wanted to quit earlier but "didn't want to leave the President in a position" without his skills - even misconduct doesn't break sycophantic bond.

### 27. Siegel's Resignation - Betraying "One Value"
> "I left. There were a few days where I stayed in the White House packing up my things. I remember the day before I left I had lunch in the White House mess with a friend—that's another thing about being in the White House. You're there for four years; you think they can have lunch with you any time. So the one person that I wanted to have lunch with in the White House, and hadn't up to that point, I asked him and no one was speaking to me. It was amazing to me. These are my friends; these are my colleagues. I hadn't done anything public at this point...But there was no reason—the reason was that I was being disloyal to the President. When you take a position like that, you can't have any intervening values. There is one value, and that is loyalty, and you can't let any values intervene. And, by letting a value intervene, I was demonstrating a huge character flaw. I thought of it the other way around." (p.22)

**Codes**: resignation-ostracism, loyalty-as-paramount, no-intervening-values, character-flaw-reversed, principled-resignation
**Memo**: CRITICAL ANTI-SYCOPHANCY EXCERPT! Siegel's principled resignation treated as ultimate betrayal. Friends stopped speaking to him immediately - even before public announcement. Logic: "you can't have any intervening values. There is one value, and that is loyalty." By putting principle (F-15 policy he disagreed with) above loyalty, demonstrated "huge character flaw" in their eyes. Siegel saw it as opposite - his integrity, their flaw. Shows how sycophantic culture makes loyalty absolute, overriding all other values. Protective factor: Siegel's principle, financial independence, willingness to sacrifice career.

### 28. Tim Craft's Hostility - Years Later
> "The person who was most hostile to me was Tim Craft, who was the appointments secretary, and was a man of no vision beyond politics. Clearly not someone who was an ideologue, or had any programmatic leanings at all. He was just a Jimmy Carter loyalist, and he despised me for what I had done. Because the word was getting out...Even that many years later—" [1982, fundraiser for Jordan] "I came with a check for one thousand dollars because Hamilton was my friend. It was like Joan Crawford or something. I walked into the room in silence. Everything stopped. They looked at me. Craft was there and he said, 'Get the hell out of here.' I was stunned. This was years after. Hamilton came over and put his arm around me and walked me into the room and broke the ice." (p.22)

**Codes**: years-later-hostility, loyalist-hatred, betrayal-never-forgiven, jordan-grace, craft-narrow-loyalty
**Memo**: Tim Craft ("man of no vision beyond politics...just a Jimmy Carter loyalist") still hostile years later. Perfect embodiment of sycophantic mindset - loyalty is everything, betrayal unforgivable. Contrast: Jordan (whom Siegel "betrayed") showed grace and friendship. Suggests most secure, powerful people less rigidly sycophantic than insecure mid-level loyalists.

### 29. Burned Bridges Consequence
> "There are consequences for me to this day. I've never wanted to be back in an administration, but I've never been asked, either. I think I've typed myself as someone who is not a team player. If Ted Kennedy had been president, I certainly would have had an important role in his administration. But, absent that kind of personal relationship, I think my action burned every bridge." (p.24)

**Codes**: permanent-consequences, not-a-team-player, burned-bridges, principled-resignation-cost
**Memo**: Lifetime consequence of anti-sycophantic behavior. "Typed myself as someone who is not a team player" - team player = loyalty over principle. Only personal relationship (Kennedy) could override this reputation. Shows how sycophantic system punishes principle - makes example of dissenters to deter others.

### 30. Professional Politicians - Conspirators Not Cooperators
> "He should expect people to be working for him or, to put it more elegantly, for the country, rather than to promote themselves. Now this is kind of hard to find, and particularly among the kind of people who are attracted to political life because people attracted to political life are intensely competitive. They're not cooperators; they're not coordinators. They're conspirators." (p.6)

**Codes**: self-promotion, political-ambition, conspirators-not-cooperators, service-ideal-impossible
**Memo**: Siegel recognizes anti-sycophantic ideal (selfless service) contradicts nature of political people - "conspirators" not servants. Suggests genuine sycophancy (subordination) conflicts with ambition driving political careers. Creates tension: need to appear deferential while actually self-promoting.

### 31. Staff Detailing Fraud - Symbol vs. Reality
> "Since we sort of established the federal bureaucracy under FDR, we've been suffering the attack of big government, big government, big government. And we use the White House as a symbol, to demonstrate that we don't believe in big government, that we believe in efficient government. A White House being the most visible point of government is the symbol. That's why I think it's—it's sad when you make these pledges and the number of people actually working in the White House, when all is said and done, could be quite a bit larger." (p.25)

**Codes**: detailing-fraud, symbolic-cuts, white-house-size, democrats-25-percent-cut
**Memo**: Democratic administrations make symbolic 25% cut pledges then detail people from agencies - performative anti-big-government gesture while maintaining or increasing actual staff. Consequence for Siegel: had to choose between assistant OR secretary, not both. Had to answer own phone while meeting with constituency leaders. Symbolic stance created real operational problems.

### 32. Professional vs. Programmatic Political Operatives
> "There is a whole group of young people, and they're in the Clinton Administration, and they're not all that attractive, actually, in terms of their characters. They didn't have the issues of civil rights, or the war or even feminism. We fought their battles for them and we won the battles. They were in their first campaign, and they won. They never even knew what it was to lose. They weren't ideologically or programmatically committed. They were in 'politics.' I met with some afterward who said to me, 'Now that we've won, I really should think of specializing in an issue.' I was struck by how it's just the inverse. We were fighting for issues and then we won. We had an issue base. These people who were political and not programmatic were thrown into the departments." (p.11)

**Codes**: politics-not-issues, winning-never-losing, shallow-commitment, clinton-generation, career-not-cause
**Memo**: New generation drawn to politics as career, not cause. Never experienced losing, no ideological commitment - "in politics" not fighting for anything. Would specialize in issue AFTER winning for resume building. These are perfect sycophants - no conflicting loyalties or principles, just ambition requiring pleasing superiors. Consequence: shallow policy understanding, loyalty to careers not causes.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Organizational Dysfunction from Anti-Hierarchical Structure**: Carter's attempt to avoid Watergate-style concentration of power created chaos - no one could convene first meeting, spokes-of-wheel model failed

2. **Loyalty vs. Competence**: Anne Wexler "too good" and rejected; Midge Costanza unqualified but loyal and selected; Pat Harris selected to fill demographic quota

3. **Formal vs. Real Power**: Watson had title, Jordan had power; staff must figure out whom to actually defer to

4. **Cabinet Government Failure**: Carter gave Cabinet autonomy to avoid being controlling; Cabinet secretaries acted independently, hired non-loyalists, defied president (Califano)

5. **Loyalty as Paramount Value**: Siegel's resignation treated as unforgivable betrayal - "can't have any intervening values"

6. **Job Insecurity Driving Behavior**: Only 3 bulletproof people; everyone else vulnerable, leading to performative hours, backstabbing, covering selves

7. **Performative Overwork**: Clinton staff competing on hours, living in White House to signal commitment

8. **Micromanaging Culture**: Carter circling typos, controlling swimming pool access through Rosalynn

9. **Selective Abuse**: Clinton's temper directed at vulnerable junior staff, never seniors - calculated exploitation of power differential

10. **Generational Shift**: New political operatives driven by career not cause, perfect sycophants with no conflicting loyalties

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Watergate trauma creating fear of hierarchy
- Outsider insecurity (Georgians) vs. Washington establishment
- Job insecurity (only 3 protected)
- Young inexperienced staff with no alternative careers
- Clinton's insecurity about senior advisers
- Campaign loyalty expectations

**Manifestations**:
- Performative hours competition
- Backstabbing to cover oneself
- Henry Mayer destroying rival
- Deterring to Jordan despite lack of title
- Selecting loyalists over competent outsiders
- Tolerating abuse without quitting
- Staff treated Siegel like pariah for principled resignation

**Consequences**:
- Organizational chaos from spokes-of-wheel
- Cabinet acting independently
- Poor personnel choices (Costanza)
- Snake pit atmosphere
- Staff burnout and family neglect
- Califano bringing in Republicans
- Loss of personnel control after Califano defiance
- Siegel's burned bridges lasting decades

**Protective Factors**:
- Siegel's principles and financial independence
- Governor Lucey's graciousness despite competition
- Jordan's friendship surviving policy disagreement (somewhat)
- Career security of bulletproof three
- Carter's work-life balance message (though not followed in Clinton WH)
