# William J. Clinton Transition - Thomas F. "Mack" McLarty III Interview
**Date**: November 16, 1999
**Interviewee**: Thomas F. "Mack" McLarty III (Chief of Staff, 1993-1994)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
McLarty discusses his tenure as Clinton's first Chief of Staff, emphasizing his "honest broker" philosophy and the challenges of transitioning from 12 years of Republican control. Key themes include managing campaign loyalists vs. governing needs, bringing in outside advisers for fresh perspectives, speaking directly to the President despite his temper, and the tension between bipartisan and partisan legislative approaches. Notable for candid discussion of structural limitations and the Harold Ickes deputy plan that fell through.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Honest Broker Philosophy
> "The feeling to have the White House and certainly the Chief of Staff's office [seen] as an honest broker. The cabinet members' ideas would be taken in and fairly and even-handedly presented to the President." (p.3)

**Codes**: honest-broker-ideal, anti-manipulation, information-integrity, fair-presentation
**Memo**: McLarty articulates anti-sycophantic ideal - Chief of Staff should fairly present information, not shape it to influence outcomes. This is explicit rejection of gatekeeping manipulation. Antecedent: desire for cabinet trust. Consequence: cabinet secretaries feel heard. Contrast to Sununu/Regan models of controlling information flow.

### 2. Not Shaping Information
> "That the chief of staff certainly needed to be viewed by cabinet members and others as someone who would not shape information in a way that would unduly affect the president's decision-making." (p.5)

**Codes**: information-integrity, anti-sycophancy-principle, cabinet-relations, trust-building
**Memo**: Explicit anti-sycophancy commitment - not shaping information to manipulate president's decisions. "Unduly affect" acknowledges some influence inevitable, but rejects intentional manipulation. Protective factor: professional integrity over personal agenda. Shows honest broker as structural anti-sycophancy mechanism.

### 3. Speaking Truth Despite Presidential Temper
> "The President shows his emotion from time to time... It's not a perpetually bad temper or a mean-spirited temper... I always did it in private; I was always respectful, but I was extremely direct with him." (p.6-7)

**Codes**: speaking-truth-to-power, managing-temperament, directness, private-confrontation
**Memo**: McLarty demonstrates anti-sycophantic behavior - being "extremely direct" despite Clinton's temper. Key protective factors: doing it in private (saves face), being respectful (maintains relationship), but uncompromising on directness. Contrast to "Oval Office effect" in Bush White House where staff evaporated when confronted. Antecedent: personal friendship enabled directness.

### 4. Campaign to Governance Transition
> "The White House and, to some extent the administration, going back to your earlier question, was clearly driven by the campaign... you have a logical transition from the campaign to the administration... To have dramatically altered that would have created a whole other set of dynamics and problems." (p.17)

**Codes**: campaign-continuity, loyalty-retention, transition-logic, personnel-decisions
**Memo**: McLarty defends keeping campaign people despite governance challenges. "Logical transition" suggests inevitability - can't abandon those who got you there. Antecedent: electoral victory creates loyalty obligations. Consequence: tension between rewarding loyalty and governance effectiveness. Sycophancy dimension: campaign loyalists expect rewards, may resist outside expertise.

### 5. Neustadt on Arrogance, Ignorance, and Adrenaline
> "Richard Neustadt... once observed... that the young people coming in to a White House are characterized by their arrogance, ignorance and adrenaline and it's difficult to handle and to make those changes." (p.15)

**Codes**: generational-hubris, inexperience, power-intoxication, expert-observation, management-challenge
**Memo**: Neustadt's famous formulation captures sycophancy antecedents. Arrogance = electoral victory hubris; ignorance = lack of governing experience; adrenaline = excitement overwhelming judgment. All three create conditions for sycophantic behavior - either excessive deference to leader who won or resistance to outside advice. McLarty citing this shows awareness of problem even as he struggled to manage it.

### 6. Outside Advisers for Freshness
> "I think if you only rely on just the internal staff, you don't quite get the creativity and spark and the freshness that ultimately serves the president the best." (p.10)

**Codes**: external-advice, avoiding-isolation, fresh-perspectives, anti-insularity
**Memo**: McLarty's deliberate anti-sycophancy strategy - bringing in outside voices prevents groupthink and insularity. "Creativity and spark and freshness" all deteriorate when only internal staff consulted. Protective factor: intentional external reality-checking. Similar to Griscom's weekly informal advisers (Reagan transition). Contrast to isolation that breeds sycophancy.

### 7. Harold Ickes Deputy Plan Falls Through
> "Harold would kind of manage down and manage the White House staff and the political side... And for various reasons, primarily the vetting process, Harold was delayed in coming in, which caused me, certainly, some management problems and challenges early on." (p.17-18)

**Codes**: organizational-planning, vetting-delays, management-structure, political-operations
**Memo**: Original plan had Ickes as Deputy COS to "manage down" - handle staff/political operations while McLarty focused on cabinet/policy. Vetting problems disrupted this, leaving McLarty without critical support. Consequence: management challenges that contributed to eventual reorganization. Shows how structural plans to prevent sycophancy (division of labor) can fail due to process obstacles.

### 8. Cabinet Secretary Relationships
> "I wanted them to feel that they would have fair access to the president; that they would have their ideas heard; that they would be treated as key participants in developing the administration." (p.3)

**Codes**: cabinet-empowerment, fair-access, inclusion, treating-as-partners
**Memo**: McLarty's anti-hierarchical approach - treating cabinet as "key participants" not subordinates to be controlled. "Fair access" contrasts with gatekeeping control. Antecedent: CEO background valuing delegation. Consequence: cabinet secretaries felt respected but potentially less White House control. Anti-sycophancy through empowerment rather than command.

### 9. Campaign Loyalists' Entitlement
> "MK: The campaign people feel that they should have jobs.
> TM: Sure, absolutely, and they deserve jobs and they should. I mean, I think you want to find a place for the people who really helped you get there." (p.15)

**Codes**: loyalty-rewards, campaign-entitlement, patronage-logic, political-debt
**Memo**: McLarty acknowledges campaign people "deserve jobs" - sycophancy as transactional. Early loyalty creates claims on positions. But tension: "find a place" suggests fitting them somewhere even if not ideal governance choice. Antecedent: campaign loyalty creating political debt. Consequence: positions filled based on loyalty rather than competence. Classic patronage logic.

### 10. Bipartisan Success vs. Partisan Struggle
> "Probably the major legislative achievement... was NAFTA, and that was done on a bipartisan basis... The economic plan, while we prevailed, was a very difficult partisan vote. We didn't get any Republican support, as I recall." (p.9)

**Codes**: bipartisan-success, partisan-difficulty, legislative-strategy, coalition-building
**Memo**: Bipartisan approach (NAFTA) = major achievement; partisan approach (budget) = struggle. Suggests governance effectiveness requires cross-party coalition, not just pleasing base. Sycophancy dimension: campaign loyalists push partisan approach, experienced advisers suggest bipartisan. McLarty's observation that bipartisan worked better = evidence against pure loyalty-based staffing.

### 11. Respecting People's Time
> "I was very respectful of people's time, including the President's. I always felt like I needed to be very efficient in terms of how I used my time and others'." (p.7)

**Codes**: efficiency, time-management, respect, professional-norms
**Memo**: Professional respect vs. sycophantic deference. McLarty respects president's time not through fearful avoidance but through efficient use. This is service without servility. Contrast to performative sycophancy (long hours competition, excessive meetings). Protective factor: business background valuing efficiency.

### 12. Learning from Rubin and Panetta
> "I would say people like Bob Rubin and Leon Panetta, both of whom have been quite candid, publicly and privately, that there needed to be more structure and more discipline in the White House operation early on." (p.11)

**Codes**: accepting-criticism, structural-reform, experienced-advisers, organizational-learning
**Memo**: McLarty accepts criticism from Rubin and Panetta about lack of structure/discipline. Anti-sycophantic behavior - acknowledging problems rather than defending. Both Rubin and Panetta had more Washington experience. Consequence: McLarty eventually replaced by Panetta as COS. Protective factor: humility to learn from others. Shows honest broker can be too permissive - anti-sycophancy can become lack of control.

### 13. Campaign vs. Governing Talent
> "MK: What you're saying is, the presidential campaigns do not offer a lot of governing opportunities so you're doing different things.
> TM: That's absolutely right. In a sense, the campaign is a great vehicle to assess a person's political skills and certainly their commitment, their energy, their creativity, but it doesn't necessarily address the management and organizational skills that are obviously needed in governing." (p.15)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-governing-skills, talent-assessment, skill-mismatch, commitment-vs-competence
**Memo**: McLarty articulates core tension - campaign proves "commitment, energy, creativity" but not "management and organizational skills." Campaign = loyalty test; governance = competence test. Sycophancy problem: campaign loyalty rewarded with governing positions requiring different skills. Consequence: committed but inexperienced staff in roles they're unprepared for. Need blend of both.

### 14. Lifelong Friendship Enabling Directness
> "President Clinton and I have been friends all of our lives... I felt like I could be direct with him and I felt like he expected that and wanted that from me." (p.2)

**Codes**: personal-relationship, friendship-foundation, directness-expectation, trust-basis
**Memo**: Lifelong friendship as protective factor against sycophancy. Personal history created expectation of directness - "he expected that and wanted that from me." Contrast to professional staffers who must earn trust or fear job loss. Antecedent: pre-existing relationship outside political context. Consequence: ability to speak truth. But paradox: friendship can also enable sycophancy if loyalty overrides candor.

### 15. Not from Campaign - Different Perspective
> "I was not part of the campaign. I had not been part of the campaign. I had supported the President, obviously, and had campaigned and spoken on his behalf and raised money and so forth, but I'd never worked in the campaign." (p.2)

**Codes**: outsider-status, non-campaign-perspective, business-background, fresh-eyes
**Memo**: McLarty's unique position - close to Clinton personally but not part of campaign machinery. Protective factor: not invested in campaign dynamics, loyalties, conflicts. Business CEO background = different management approach than political operatives. But consequence: less understanding of campaign people's expectations and culture. Neutral position between campaign loyalists and Washington establishment.

### 16. Roy Neel's Transition Role
> "Roy Neel... had run the transition and, probably more than anyone other than the president-elect, in terms of bringing people in and getting people in and screening for positions... He had been in an important senior staff role with Vice President Gore." (p.2)

**Codes**: transition-machinery, personnel-screening, Gore-network, campaign-to-governance
**Memo**: Neel as transition director controlled initial personnel decisions. "Bringing people in and getting people in" suggests gatekeeping role. Gore connection = separate loyalty network from Clinton campaign. Antecedent: vice presidential staff integration. Consequence: multiple power centers (Clinton campaign, Gore staff, McLarty outsiders). Potential for competing sycophantic relationships.

### 17. Proper Process Over Speed
> "MK: When you were doing the appointments, you said you wanted to make sure that the people coming in were properly vetted. The problem was, it took a long time to get them vetted.
> TM: Right. I thought it was important to do it properly." (p.16)

**Codes**: vetting-discipline, process-integrity, patience-vs-speed, proper-procedure
**Memo**: McLarty prioritized "properly" over quickly - anti-sycophantic in refusing to cut corners despite pressure. But consequence: delays (like Ickes) created management problems. Trade-off between thorough vetting (prevents scandals) and rapid staffing (enables quick action). Protective factor: commitment to process integrity. Shows professional norms competing with political urgency.

### 18. Cabinet Meetings as Performance
> "Cabinet meetings, while useful for certain things, are not the most efficient means of policymaking or decision-making, because you have a large group and there's a lot of showboating, if you will, that goes on." (p.5)

**Codes**: performative-behavior, cabinet-dynamics, efficiency-vs-theater, group-dynamics
**Memo**: McLarty recognizes cabinet meetings breed "showboating" - performative sycophancy where members speak to impress president rather than solve problems. Large group dynamics encourage performance over substance. Antecedent: presidential audience creating incentive to grandstand. Consequence: inefficient decision-making. Anti-sycophancy response: smaller meetings, one-on-one discussions for real work.

### 19. Washington Experience Value
> "I think there's no question, looking back, that I underestimated the need for more Washington experience in the early days of the administration... I probably should have placed more value on Washington experience." (p.11)

**Codes**: self-critique, washington-expertise, learning-curve, institutional-knowledge
**Memo**: McLarty's retrospective admission - underestimated value of Washington expertise vs. campaign loyalty or business competence. Anti-sycophancy through honest self-assessment. Consequence of overweighting loyalty/friendship: governance struggles that required mid-course correction (Panetta replacing McLarty). Shows campaign hubris (we won, we know best) creates blind spot about institutional knowledge needs.

### 20. Protecting President's Political Capital
> "You have to be very careful about spending the president's political capital, because it is his most valuable commodity and once it's gone, it's very hard to get back." (p.9)

**Codes**: political-capital, resource-management, strategic-thinking, protective-role
**Memo**: McLarty understands COS role as protecting president's most valuable resource. Strategic service vs. sycophantic compliance - saying no to protect capital even when president wants to spend it. "Very careful" suggests restraining function. Anti-sycophancy: prioritizing president's long-term interests over short-term desires. Requires speaking truth about costs.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Honest Broker Ideal**: Explicit commitment to fair presentation of information without manipulation
2. **Campaign Loyalty vs. Governing Competence**: Tension between rewarding campaign people and staffing for effective governance
3. **Outside Perspectives**: Deliberate strategy to bring in external advisers to prevent insularity
4. **Speaking Truth to Temper**: Being "extremely direct" with Clinton despite his emotional reactions
5. **Friendship as Double-Edged**: Personal relationship enabled directness but also created blind spots
6. **Structure vs. Access**: McLarty's permissive style valued as anti-hierarchical but criticized as lacking discipline
7. **Bipartisan Effectiveness**: Legislative success came from cross-party coalition, not pure loyalty to base
8. **Arrogance, Ignorance, Adrenaline**: Neustadt's formulation of young staff vulnerabilities
