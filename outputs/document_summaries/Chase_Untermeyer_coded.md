# George H. W. Bush Transition - Chase Untermeyer Interview
**Date**: July 6, 1999
**Interviewee**: Chase Untermeyer (Director, Office of Presidential Personnel)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Untermeyer was Director of Presidential Personnel for George H.W. Bush (1989-1991), appointed the morning after the 1988 election. This interview provides extensive detail on the presidential appointments process, the tension between campaign loyalists and professional expertise, battles with Cabinet secretaries over "their" appointments, and the mechanics of rewarding political supporters. Unlike the Nixon interviews focused on fear-based sycophancy, this reveals patronage-based sycophancy - loyalty to whoever got you the job (Cabinet secretary, senator, president) and the currency of campaign work in securing appointments. Notable for insights on the "White House narcotic," Schedule C appointments for campaign workers, and the importance of personnel director having close relationship with president.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. "My Appointments" - Cabinet Secretary Ownership
> "Some of the better organized, meaning more political, people such as Elizabeth Dole, would come with their names of people they wanted to be in, what they kept saying [was] 'my appointments.' I resolved that in the awful circumstance that would I ever have to do this work again that I would make sure that anybody, any Cabinet secretary, who said 'my appointment' would immediately have a pre-signed letter of resignation exercised because they are the president's appointments. The Cabinet secretaries do view them as 'my appointments'." (p.7)

**Codes**: appointment-ownership, cabinet-control, presidential-vs-cabinet-authority, possessive-language
**Memo**: Cabinet secretaries claiming appointments as "theirs" rather than president's. Untermeyer's hyperbolic solution (pre-signed resignation) shows how offensive this is to personnel operation. But acknowledges reality: "The Cabinet secretaries do view them as 'my appointments'." Antecedent: Cabinet secretary wanting own team. Manifestation: possessive language, control claims. Sycophancy issue: appointees will be loyal to whoever they think controls their job.

### 2. Campaign Loyalists vs. Professionals - Two-Tier System
> "Pat Buchanan and Haldeman and Ehrlichman and a number of others were all campaign workers. They all had easy access to the President because they were campaign guys. We professionals, even compared to Nixon supporters way down to the grassroots level, were second-class citizens. Not in the sense that we didn't have full openness to everything, it was just that the Attorney General, John Mitchell, and those who had been part of the early campaign seemed always to have a leg up on the professionals." (p.10-11)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-professional, loyalty-hierarchy, second-class-status, access-based-on-campaign-work
**Memo**: Two-tier system based on campaign participation. Campaign workers = "easy access," "leg up." Professionals = "second-class citizens" despite expertise. Early loyalty trumps competence for access/status. Shows sycophancy as currency - campaign work buys privileged position. Pattern across administrations (Nixon, Bush).

### 3. Loyalty to President vs. Loyalty to Sponsor
> "You can have general support to the president or theoretical support but specific loyalty to the person who hired you such as a Cabinet secretary or such as an important senator who insisted on your getting a job. Those are the people, I contend, who when things get tough are the first ones to be grumbling at cocktail parties or over breakfast with a Washington Post reporter about the stupid decisions being made in the Oval Office, including by the occupant of that office. Whereas the person of demonstrated loyalty is less likely to do that." (p.8-9)

**Codes**: loyalty-competing-principals, loyalty-to-sponsor-vs-president, leaking, grumbling
**Memo**: Core sycophancy problem in appointments: appointees loyal to whoever got them the job, not necessarily the president. If senator or Cabinet secretary secured appointment, that's where loyalty flows. Consequence: grumbling to press, disloyalty when "things get tough." Explains importance of Presidential Personnel controlling appointments - ensures loyalty flows to president not intermediaries.

### 4. Qualifications vs. Ability - Broader Test
> "The issue I always addressed on the question of qualifications was that qualifications are not what you are truly seeking; you are seeking the ability to handle a job. And ability is a much broader test because ability can, yes, include qualifications but ability can also exclude qualifications for a particular job if the person is generally smart, savvy in a Washington way, able to work in and succeed in a bureaucracy and dealings with the Hill, et cetera. [...] But if the person has an absolute tin ear with regard to dealings with Congress or interest groups or the press or if they are unpleasant individuals who are going to guarantee bad working conditions in the department, if they are totally incapable of cooperative relations with Cabinet colleagues then, qualifications notwithstanding, that is a bad choice." (p.9)

**Codes**: ability-vs-qualifications, washington-savvy, political-skills, interpersonal-capacity
**Memo**: Untermeyer's framework: "ability" (broad) vs. "qualifications" (narrow expertise). Ability includes: Washington savvy, bureaucratic navigation, Hill relations, not being "unpleasant." This is anti-narrow-expertise but requires political/social skills that can enable sycophancy (knowing how to work system, relationships). Contrast: pure technocrat vs. politically skilled operator.

### 5. Schedule C Appointments - Rewarding Campaign Workers
> "In the opening days of the Bush transition [...] Lee Atwater [...] made me realize there was this extra continent of appointments that needed to be made. He was absolutely right; these were the people who worked hard to elect the president; they needed to be taken care of; they needed to be remembered. [...] These are the people who did work in the campaign or at least should have worked in the campaign. [...] That is where you put the folks who slept on floors in New Hampshire and worked for practically nothing and maybe sometimes exactly nothing during the course of the campaign." (p.18)

**Codes**: schedule-c-appointments, campaign-rewards, patronage, sleeping-on-floors, political-debt
**Memo**: Explicit patronage system for campaign workers - Schedule C appointments (political appointees through GS-15). "Slept on floors in New Hampshire" = shorthand for campaign sacrifice deserving reward. Atwater's story: he sat in empty apartment waiting for promised job after South Carolina campaign. System designed to ensure campaign workers "taken care of." Pure sycophancy currency - early loyalty = job entitlement.

### 6. Scott Bush and Schedule C Project
> "The person I thought of putting in charge of that was Scott Bush. Scott Bush was President Bush's nephew, the son of William H. T. 'Bucky' Bush of St. Louis. Scott Bush had worked on the campaign and everybody knew it. [...] Because of his name he could speak with that authority and nobody would question his credentials either to speak or to make a fair judgment because he had been there himself. [...] I briefed the Cabinet in a memorable moment telling them the number of Schedule C positions they had and that we would send over names for people to fill those positions." (p.19)

**Codes**: family-member-authority, nepotism-advantage, campaign-worker-placement, cabinet-pushback
**Memo**: President's nephew put in charge of placing campaign workers in Schedule C positions. His family name gave him authority Cabinet secretaries couldn't question. Jack Kemp's resistance: "You mean I have to hire somebody just because they worked in the campaign?" Untermeyer's response invokes future reciprocity: "eight years from now if you're the president-elect you will want people who worked on your campaign in these positions too." Shows systematic patronage, family leverage, and cycle of loyalty-based hiring.

### 7. "Silent Committee" - George W. Bush Taking Care of Deserving
> "George W. Bush immediately after the 1988 election was the chair of something called the Silent Committee which was put together of people who like myself had been in the Bush world for a number of years and knew the other people who have been in the Bush world. The whole idea of that exercise was to put together the list of the absolutely deserving, those who if they wanted an appointment or some other consideration, such as a part-time advisory board or member of an international delegation, would get it. They were the ones to be taken care of. That wasn't the Schedule C group and it wasn't all the other worthies, the donors and other sorts. These were kind of the ordinary folk who would be overwhelmed or run over in the stampede if there wasn't someone looking out after them." (p.30)

**Codes**: silent-committee, absolutely-deserving, loyalty-tracking, family-oversight, stampede-protection
**Memo**: Formalized system for tracking "absolutely deserving" - campaign loyalists who shouldn't be "overwhelmed or run over in the stampede" of job-seekers. George W. Bush as chair shows family role in loyalty management. Creates hierarchy: (1) absolutely deserving, (2) Schedule C campaign workers, (3) donors, (4) everyone else. Sycophancy institutionalized as multi-tier patronage system.

### 8. Cabinet Secretary Freeze-Out of Unwanted Appointees
> "If truly the White House does dictate appointees without any cooperation, give and take, with the Cabinet secretary, then the appointee may well arrive in that department and walk into his or beautiful office but never be told about the staff meeting or never get the key piece of paper or not be invited on the retreat or all the other kinds of things the Cabinet secretary can do to freeze out somebody whom the Cabinet secretary doesn't truly believe is one of them." (p.8)

**Codes**: freeze-out, cabinet-retaliation, exclusion-tactics, withholding-information, passive-resistance
**Memo**: Cabinet secretaries' revenge for appointees forced on them: exclusion from meetings, withholding papers, not invited to retreats. Creates double-bind for appointee - formally appointed but functionally excluded. Shows limits of formal authority without genuine acceptance. Sycophancy implication: appointees need both White House and Cabinet secretary support; lacking either = dysfunction.

### 9. Presidential Personnel Director Needing Presidential Relationship
> "It wasn't a delegation of presidential authority but that was an expression of the kind of relationship a president should have with the personnel director. It's the reason I think the job description of the personnel director must be somebody whom the president knows personally and has that degree of confidence not just so that the personnel director can go forth knowing the president has that kind of confidence but also so that everybody else in the system, in the White House, in the departments and agencies, in the press, in the Congress, knows that the personnel director speaks with that degree of authority. It also helps prevent the I won't say 'game playing'—you can't quite prevent that—but it is a discouragement to game playing if it is known that the personnel director has that degree of trust." (p.17)

**Codes**: presidential-relationship-requirement, delegated-authority, preventing-end-runs, trust-as-power
**Memo**: Personnel director must have known personal relationship with president or people will "get around the roadblock" through chief of staff, legislative liaison, etc. Authority comes from known proximity to president, not formal title. Prevents "game playing" = end-runs around personnel office. Shows sycophancy hierarchy: personnel director's power derives from relationship to president; others' attempts to bypass show they're playing sycophancy game through alternative routes.

### 10. White House Narcotic vs. Actual Governing
> "There's no way around it. They are the help. They are the ones who've got to do what the President wants or bring to him what they think he wants [...] But I think in the end you can't get away from the fact—and this is why I said that I don't want to denigrate being in the White House but there is no way around the fact that it is a place of staff work. And staff work is the preparation and selling of paper as much as anything. [...] The other is sort of the opposite, which you can call the White House narcotic, the sense that this is all too wonderful, I can't possibly leave it; I can't possibly leave being in a situation in which if you walk into the White House Mess you see famous people or various Cabinet secretaries; or out on the lawn: 'There are all these flags today. I wonder who's coming?' [...] All of that is wonderful to the degree of telling stories at the Thanksgiving dinner table but from the point of view of really doing anything with your life I think it's of limited value." (p.23, 25)

**Codes**: white-house-narcotic, staff-work-reality, glorified-paper-pushing, intoxication-with-proximity, limited-value
**Memo**: "White House narcotic" = intoxication with proximity to power/fame without actual governing. Untermeyer's blunt assessment: White House staff are "the help," doing "glorified staff work," "preparation and selling of paper." Value is "telling stories at Thanksgiving dinner table" not substantive policy. Twice voluntarily left White House for departments where "actual governing" happens. Anti-sycophancy insight: recognizing that being close to power ≠ wielding power. Narcotic = seduction of proximity that prevents clear-eyed assessment of actual role.

### 11. Term Limits for White House Staff - Combating Narcotic
> "I also believe that there should be what I call term limits for the White House staff. That is, at the mid-point of an administration before burnout occurs and before people do get hooked too much on the narcotic of the White House that there be a—and everyone knows this in advance—a grand exchange of personnel in which the White House staffers will be sent out to the departments and agencies in appropriate positions [...] and people serving in those capacities in the departments and agencies will be invited to come on the White House staff." (p.23)

**Codes**: term-limits-proposal, anti-narcotic-measure, white-house-to-agencies-exchange, preventing-addiction
**Memo**: Untermeyer's solution to White House narcotic: mandatory mid-administration exchange. White House staff to departments (get substantive governing experience), department people to White House (bring operational knowledge). Prevents both burnout and addiction to proximity. Also gives Cabinet secretaries "their best people would be their contacts on the White House staff, perfect plants, if you will." Anti-sycophancy through mandatory rotation preventing identification with position.

### 12. Leaving Washington - Perspective Recovery
> "I very much believe that there should be what I call term limits for the White House staff. [...] I'm persuaded that there's something to the notion that you should leave Washington, go back to where you came from and see how things are in perspective. [...] When I left the White House, the President was at an all-time high. It was February of 1972. I didn't take— [...] What did I learn? I didn't learn anything that's helped me productively. I learned a lot of things that I would not implement in a business. Like Haldeman told me in my exit interview, you can't run a business like this." (p.27)

**Codes**: leaving-washington, perspective-recovery, learning-what-not-to-do, geographic-distance
**Memo**: Leaving Washington provides perspective impossible to maintain while immersed. Untermeyer advocates geographic departure, not just job change. Compare to Griscom's external advisers (maintaining perspective while staying) vs. Untermeyer's departure (regaining perspective after leaving). Both recognize danger of losing grounding in Washington. Note: cites Haldeman quote about business management, showing even Haldeman knew his approach was specific to (and perhaps only acceptable in) White House context.

### 13. Reagan Administration Holdovers - Continuity vs. New Loyalty
> "There are still to this day a number of people who were in the Reagan Administration—I think more at the Schedule C ranks and at the deputy assistant secretary ranks, rather than the presidential ranks --- who feel like they were abused by the incoming Bush Administration; they were all fired. That's not true in every instance. As I indicated, we wanted people with experience and we were on the same team so we knew we could trust those people better than total newcomers. At the same token, it is impossible to put together an administration freshly elected with people who have been in places like Austin, Texas, without having to create vacancies and the jobs were held by Reagan appointees." (p.27-28)

**Codes**: reagan-holdover-resentment, same-party-transition, creating-vacancies, loyalty-vs-experience-tension
**Memo**: Even same-party transition (Reagan to Bush, first in 60 years) created resentment. Reagan appointees felt "abused" by being replaced despite being "same team." But Bush campaign workers needed jobs. Tension: experience/continuity vs. rewarding new loyalty. Untermeyer admits Bush transition "very, very painful" and Cabinet secretaries less "kind and gentle" than hoped. Shows patronage imperative trumps even same-party continuity.

### 14. Translating Electoral Mandate into Personnel
> "The whole presidential personnel process isn't just about patronage; it isn't just about giving rewards to the faithful; it isn't just about trying to get loyal folk who you hope are going to do what the President wants. But it's all about translating the mandate of the people in the election into flesh and blood so that if you supported a particular president who happens to have been defeated then you shouldn't work for the next president because, by definition, you are not the kind of people who believe in what that person stands for and you are not the kind of person that the people of the country unconsciously wanted to have in that particular position." (p.28)

**Codes**: mandate-translation, electoral-legitimacy, personnel-as-policy, leaving-after-defeat
**Memo**: Untermeyer's high-minded rationale for patronage: appointments "translate the mandate of the people in the election into flesh and blood." Appointees embody electoral choice, so should leave when their president loses. But this conflicts with earlier emphasis on campaign loyalty rewarding system. Tension: is it about translating policy mandate or rewarding political workers? Probably both, but the idealistic framing masks the patronage reality.

### 15. Regulatory Commission Seats - Clinton Giving Away Presidential Power
> "I think the Clinton administration in its headlong effort to deprive the presidency of various powers it has enjoyed over the years has given away one immense power that has not been given any attention. [...] Bob Dole, the Senate Minority Leader at that time, said to the President or some representative of the President that, 'On regulatory commissions for the so-called Republican seats, I want to be the one to tell you who they are.' And the White House Personnel Office and maybe the President himself said okay. As a result, during this administration, the Senate Republican leader has pretty well led the selection process by which so-called Republican seats on the regulatory commissions have been filled." (p.11)

**Codes**: giving-away-power, senate-control-of-appointments, regulatory-commission-seats, clinton-capitulation
**Memo**: Untermeyer's outrage at Clinton letting Dole control "Republican" regulatory commission seats. Points out law doesn't mandate party seats, just "not more than simple majority" of one party - could appoint independents aligned with president. Baby duck theory: regulatory commissioner loyal to whoever secured appointment (senator not president). If senator gets them appointed, Executive Branch loses ability to influence them but Congress can lobby them. Major erosion of presidential power through sycophancy to wrong master.

### 16. Loyalty vs. Expertise - Cabinet Secretary's Argument
> "That would be the argument a Cabinet secretary would give in filling a particular role in which the Cabinet secretary would say, 'My guy is smarter than your guy, your ex-campaigner, on this subject'—whatever the subject is, international affairs or press or legislative liaison, whatever it may be. And that will be a point which the Cabinet secretary no doubt will be willing to fight the fight all the way in to the Oval Office to prove. And it may well be in the give and take of things or the influence of the Cabinet secretary that he will concede that point." (p.9)

**Codes**: expertise-vs-loyalty-argument, cabinet-fighting-to-oval, my-guy-vs-your-guy, giving-and-taking
**Memo**: Cabinet secretary's pitch: "My guy is smarter than your guy." Expertise argument against campaign loyalist. But Untermeyer notes strong Cabinet secretaries with presidential relationships (Baker, Brady, Weinberger, Cheney) "can pretty well dictate" and "in case of a tie the Cabinet secretary is going to win." Shows limits of personnel office's power when Cabinet secretary has direct presidential relationship. Sycophancy hierarchy: closeness to president trumps formal personnel process.

### 17. Cabinet Secretary If Willing to Go to Oval Office Will Win
> "Secretary Cheney clearly wanted the people he knew and he got his way, as I think any strong-minded Cabinet secretary will do. And there are a couple, three cases I can think of in which Secretary Cheney who is, of course, a former White House chief of staff actually went to the Oval Office on some assistant secretarial appointments in the Defense Department where John Sununu and I had another candidate. I mentioned this to my former boss, John Lehman, who had been Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration and he laughed. He said, 'Of course, you know that if a Cabinet secretary is willing to take an issue to the Oval Office he will win. He can't go to the Oval Office every time so that means that you're likely to win the next one.'" (p.11)

**Codes**: cabinet-secretary-winning-at-oval, going-to-president-directly, pick-your-battles, cabinet-leverage
**Memo**: Key insight: "if a Cabinet secretary is willing to take an issue to the Oval Office he will win." Cabinet secretary can't use this tactic every time (would burn capital), so personnel office "likely to win the next one." Strategic calculation on both sides about when to escalate. Shows formal personnel process subordinate to Cabinet secretary-president relationship. Sycophancy dynamic: president won't overrule Cabinet secretary who escalates to him directly (loyalty to Cabinet secretary trumps personnel director's recommendation).

### 18. Jack Kemp Pushback on Schedule C Mandate
> "In a private session with Jack Kemp, the secretary-designate of HUD [Housing and Urban Development], I mentioned this would happen and he turned blustery as he easily does and he said, 'You mean I have to hire somebody just because they worked in the campaign?' My comment back to him was, 'Yes. And not only that, eight years from now if you're the president-elect you will want people who worked on your campaign in these positions too and a Cabinet secretary may ask the same question and I hope your director of personnel gives the same answer.'" (p.19)

**Codes**: cabinet-resistance-to-campaign-hires, kemp-pushback, future-reciprocity-argument, patronage-perpetuation
**Memo**: Kemp (who ran for president, lost to Bush) resists hiring campaign workers just for campaign work. Untermeyer's argument: future reciprocity - "eight years from now" when Kemp is president, he'll want same system for his campaign workers. Argument for perpetuating patronage system across administrations. Shows Cabinet secretaries understand (and resent) being forced to hire based on political loyalty rather than their own preferences.

### 19. Telling People No - Hope Springs Eternal
> "There's this remarkable ability of I guess hope springing eternal in the breast of every individual that if you say something diplomatic like 'Well, Fred, it doesn't look like you're going to get to be ambassador to Belgium,' Fred will hear 'doesn't look like' and will think: 'He didn't say I wouldn't be which means that I might be which means that I will be!' Fred may leave the room convinced that he should go pack his bags. That is slightly overstating the case but it isn't exaggerating the case. There are people who unless they are clear that you are clear that the answer is no will not think the game is done." (p.9-10)

**Codes**: telling-people-no, hope-springs-eternal, diplomatic-ambiguity, clear-rejection-needed
**Memo**: Job-seekers hear what they want to hear. Diplomatic language ("doesn't look like") interpreted as "maybe" interpreted as "yes." People won't stop pursuing unless explicitly told "no." Shows appointment process as site of hope, desperation, self-deception. Sycophancy connection: people so eager for position they'll misinterpret any ambiguity as encouragement. Personnel director must be blunt to prevent false hope.

### 20. Hundreds of Phone Calls - Call Sheet Triage
> "At the start of the administration it truly is ridiculously high: hundreds. And I remember in the early days of the administration looking at my call sheets. It would be quarter of eight. It would be that hour of the night and I would look at my call sheets. Here would be page after page of some of the most important people in the country, people who are used to having their calls taken immediately let alone [returned] the same day, and here are people whose phone calls I simply could not and would not return. [...] At least I worked out a color-coding system with my assistant so that members of the Senate were on blue pieces of paper and cabinet officers were on yellow pieces of paper and I could do triage by color." (p.29)

**Codes**: call-volume, phone-triage, color-coding-by-importance, unreturned-calls, important-people-ignored
**Memo**: Hundreds of calls daily from "most important people in the country." Color-coded triage: (1) own staff, (2) other White House staff, (3) Cabinet secretaries, (4) senators, (5) House members/governors/party leaders/business magnates. "Important people" on white sheets often didn't get calls returned. Shows overwhelming demand for personnel director's attention. Sycophancy implication: even very powerful people (who normally receive deference) couldn't get through. Personnel director at center of power - can ignore even powerful people because controlling more valuable resource (jobs).

### 21. Interviewing Finalists - Taking Notes for Accountability
> "I made sure I interviewed everyone who was a finalist, usually the only finalist but the person with whom in working out the deal with my staff and the Cabinet officer or other principle was clear was going to be the final person. I would want to bring that person into the office and have the eye-to-eye conversation. I took very careful notes. Some of my primary donations to the Bush Library are many volumes of fairly thin notebooks which were as much as my reportorial skills of shorthand allowed fairly verbatim notes as to what that individual told me. So that if, as happened on several occasions, that individual in office did something different I could at least go back and say, 'Well, the person in the interview when I asked this question answered this way and it's clear that they've changed their mind.'" (p.29-30)

**Codes**: interview-notes, accountability-documentation, changed-positions, bush-library-donation
**Memo**: Untermeyer kept detailed interview notes of what appointees promised, donated to Bush Library. Purpose: if appointee "did something different" could prove they'd "changed their mind." Accountability mechanism - documented commitments. But also creates record for historical research on who was appointed and what they pledged. Sycophancy relevance: appointees may have said what personnel director wanted to hear in interview, then acted differently once in position (classic sycophancy - tell authority what they want, do what you want later).

### 22. Evaluating Appointee Performance with Cabinet Secretaries
> "This was something I also decided to do and I knew I couldn't do it until after the better part of a year had gone by. The way I did it was to go to the Cabinet secretaries, get on their schedule. I would go there and sit with them and, on a very confidential basis, usually one on one, talk about the performance of these appointees. [...] In most every department there was one or another appointee the Cabinet secretary was known not to like and I would often hear that ahead of time because the Office of Presidential Personnel is a very frequent drop-in point for a Cabinet secretary who is over in the West Wing." (p.25)

**Codes**: performance-evaluation, cabinet-secretary-feedback, disliked-appointees, confidential-reviews
**Memo**: After year, Untermeyer consulted Cabinet secretaries one-on-one about appointee performance. Cabinet secretaries "drop in" Presidential Personnel office to complain about appointees. On some "problem cases" Untermeyer concluded "yes, that was not the right choice, we need to make a change or that person needs to go." Personnel director as firing agent: "it is one of the duties of the Director of Presidential Personnel as the voice of the President to do the hiring and the firing or at least the announcement of same rather than the Cabinet secretary." Maintains presidential control over appointments even in firing.

### 23. Mentoring for Struggling Appointees
> "If, let's say, an assistant secretary was having trouble with a Cabinet secretary or if the Cabinet secretary felt the person wasn't growing enough or doing things the right way that before you show them the door, especially if it's somebody you care about, somebody who worked in the administration, maybe a minority appointment of some sort who may have had to take on risk to some degree that they would be assigned a mentor on a very confidential basis to let them talk things out. I wouldn't even want to hear what they talked about when they got together so much as it might help that appointee to do things differently or approach things differently." (p.25-26)

**Codes**: mentoring-struggling-appointees, council-for-excellence, second-chance, minority-appointees
**Memo**: Before firing appointee having trouble, assign mentor (from Council for Excellence in Government - former appointees). Confidential conversations to help appointee "do things differently or approach things differently." Shows concern for appointees "you care about" - campaign workers, minorities who "took on risk." Protective mechanism within patronage system - loyalty earns you second chance through mentoring rather than immediate firing.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Patronage as Systematic Loyalty Currency**: Explicit system for rewarding campaign workers ("slept on floors in New Hampshire") through Schedule C appointments and priority consideration
2. **Multiple Competing Loyalties**: Tension between loyalty to president vs. Cabinet secretary vs. senator who secured appointment - appointees loyal to whoever controls their job
3. **Campaign Work as Entitlement**: Early loyalty in campaign creates moral claim to appointment regardless of qualifications - "absolutely deserving"
4. **Cabinet Secretary Ownership vs. Presidential Authority**: Battle over whether appointments are "my appointments" (Cabinet) or president's appointments (White House)
5. **White House Narcotic**: Intoxication with proximity to power creates addiction that prevents people from leaving despite limited substantive value
6. **Access Hierarchy Based on Campaign Service**: Campaign workers have "easy access" and are prioritized; professionals are "second-class citizens"
7. **Regulatory Commission Seat Giveaway**: Clinton administration letting Senate control "Republican" seats creates commissioners loyal to senators not president
8. **Personnel Director Authority Through Presidential Relationship**: Power derives from known personal relationship with president, not formal title; prevents end-runs
9. **Strong Cabinet Secretaries Win**: Cabinet secretary willing to escalate to Oval Office will win appointment battle; can't do it every time but will win when they do
10. **Expertise vs. Loyalty**: Ongoing tension between "qualifications" (narrow expertise) and "ability" (Washington savvy, loyalty, political skills)

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Campaign participation creating moral claim to appointment
- Cabinet secretary wanting own loyal team
- Senator securing appointment for constituent/supporter
- Proximity to president (White House narcotic)
- Electoral victory creating patronage obligations
- Same-party transition still requiring rewards for new campaign workers

**Manifestations**:
- Cabinet secretaries calling appointments "my appointments"
- Campaign workers as "second-class" vs. professionals
- "Silent Committee" tracking "absolutely deserving"
- Schedule C placement for campaign workers
- Freeze-out tactics against unwanted appointees (no meeting invites, withholding papers)
- Leaking/grumbling by appointees loyal to sponsor not president
- Unrealistic hope/persistence by job-seekers
- Cabinet secretaries dropping by Personnel office to complain about appointees

**Consequences**:
- Appointees loyal to sponsor (Cabinet secretary, senator) rather than president
- Grumbling to press by appointees not loyal to president
- White House narcotic preventing people from leaving despite burnout
- Regulatory commissioners loyal to senators not president
- Less effective governance when loyalty trumps competence
- Resentment from Reagan holdovers displaced despite being "same team"
- Cabinet secretaries freezing out appointees forced on them

**Protective Factors** (Anti-Sycophancy):
- Personnel director having close personal relationship with president (authority to resist Cabinet/Senate pressure)
- Untermeyer's "ability" test (broader than narrow qualifications)
- Evaluation process to catch failing appointees
- Mentoring for struggling appointees before firing
- Leaving Washington to regain perspective
- Term limits for White House staff to combat narcotic
- Recognizing White House as "staff work" not actual governing
- Blunt honesty in telling people "no"

**Structural Features**:
- Schedule C system formalizes patronage
- "Silent Committee" institutionalizes loyalty tracking
- Color-coded call sheets create hierarchy of deference
- Regulatory commission structure enables Senate control
- Cabinet secretary drop-ins enable informal influence
- "Baby duck" theory: appointees imprint on whoever secured their appointment

## Broader Significance

This interview provides systematic documentation of patronage-based sycophancy in presidential appointments - fundamentally different from fear-based sycophancy (Nixon/Haldeman) but equally important for understanding how loyalty systems work in government.

**Key Insights**:

1. **Loyalty as Competing Commodity**: Unlike Nixon interviews where loyalty flowed upward through fear, Bush administration shows loyalty as contested - appointees may be loyal to Cabinet secretary, senator, or president depending on who secured their job. This creates "baby duck" problem: appointees imprint on first person they see when they "pop out of shell."

2. **Patronage as Explicit System**: Unlike implicit sycophancy in other interviews, Untermeyer describes explicit, formalized systems: Schedule C for campaign workers, "Silent Committee" for "absolutely deserving," color-coded call triage. Sycophancy institutionalized rather than informal.

3. **White House Narcotic**: Powerful metaphor for how proximity to power becomes addictive despite limited substantive value. People can't leave because they're "hooked" on seeing famous people, not because they're doing important work. Shows sycophancy as seduction of proximity.

4. **Cabinet Secretary Power**: Strong Cabinet secretaries with presidential relationships can "pretty well dictate" appointments. "If willing to take issue to Oval Office he will win." Shows limits of formal personnel process when personal relationships intervene. Sycophancy operates through multiple channels.

5. **Mandate Translation vs. Loyalty Rewards**: Untermeyer offers high-minded rationale (appointments "translate electoral mandate into flesh and blood") alongside brutal reality (campaign workers "slept on floors" so deserve jobs). Tension between democratic legitimacy argument and raw patronage.

6. **Two-Tier System**: Campaign workers vs. professionals as "second-class citizens" creates explicit hierarchy. Early loyalty (campaign) valued over competence (expertise). Pattern across administrations (Nixon, Bush).

7. **Regulatory Commission Giveaway**: Clinton's capitulation to Dole letting Senate control "Republican" seats shows how sycophancy to wrong master (Senate not president) erodes presidential power. Commissioners loyal to senators, not president.

Most revealing: Untermeyer served twice in White House, twice left voluntarily because recognized it as "glorified staff work" despite "White House narcotic." His clear-eyed assessment - White House staff are "the help," value is "Thanksgiving dinner stories" - shows capacity to resist seduction of proximity. But same person ran systematic patronage operation rewarding campaign loyalty. Not hypocritical - different dimensions of sycophancy. Can resist narcotic of proximity while operating loyalty-based appointment system.

Contrast with Nixon interviews: Huntsman described terror ("years to get over fear of Haldeman"), learned "how not to treat people." Untermeyer describes patronage mechanics, loyalty competition, White House narcotic. Different sycophancy systems: fear-based (Nixon) vs. patronage-based (Bush). Both create loyalty to person/faction rather than mission.
