# Richard M. Nixon Transition - Fred Malek Interview
**Date**: November 23, 1999
**Interviewee**: Fred Malek (Director, Office of Presidential Personnel)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Malek discusses creating professional executive search capacity in White House Personnel Office, moving beyond "Bunch Of Guys Around A Table" (BOGAAT) and political recommendations to merit-based recruitment. Key themes include tension between political loyalty and competence, "developed" vs. "proven" loyalty, campaign vs. governing personnel differences, complementary vs. comfortable staffing, making politically-sponsored nominees "sweat" through competitive process, and Haldeman as excellent but ultimately tested by "loyalty in a very undesirable way."

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Secretary's Comfortable Choices vs. Most Qualified
> "The problem you ran into was sometimes the Departments—sometimes they would have absolutely great candidates; sometimes they would be recommending someone who the Secretary just happened to know a long time, and felt comfortable with, even though - in our estimation - that person might not have been the most qualified. So there is always a lot of tugging and pulling, because you can't force someone upon a Cabinet member or agency head. You have to have someone who is going to be compatible, and work together. So there were compromises that you would make." (p.3)

**Codes**: comfort-vs-competence, personal-familiarity, compromise, compatibility
**Memo**: Secretaries often recommend "someone who the Secretary just happened to know a long time, and felt comfortable with" over "most qualified." Classic sycophancy dynamic - comfort/familiarity over merit. But "can't force" appointee on Secretary, so compromises made. Antecedent: personal relationships. Consequence: suboptimal appointments.

### 2. Complementary vs. Mirror Staffing
> "MK: When you were recruiting, did you try to find people that complemented the person that they would be working for?
> FM: Yes.
> MK: Nobody has everything.
> FM: Yes, we did. We tried to find people who would shore them up and make for a better overall team.
> MK: So, for a political person who maybe was not a good organizer—.
> FM: Then, the Undersecretary should not be the same type of person, but someone who is really a good overall executive." (p.3)

**Codes**: complementary-staffing, shoring-up-weaknesses, strategic-team-building
**Memo**: Actively sought people who "would shore them up" - complement rather than mirror. For political person not good organizer, get "good overall executive" as Undersecretary. Anti-sycophancy strategy - diversity of skills vs. comfortable similarity. Contrast to Hartmann's "leaders surround themselves with people who are models of themselves."

### 3. Developed vs. Proven Loyalty
> "I didn't have much of a conversation with him early on. [H. R.] Haldeman really ran the White House for him. He was not that interested in managing the White House. He was interested in making the selections, and he made it clear that he wanted people involved and he wanted people who were loyal to him. My argument was always on that score, agreed, but: don't assume somebody who hadn't worked for you in the past isn't loyal to you. Maybe they didn't know they could work for you. Maybe they haven't been involved in politics, but there can be developed loyalty; it doesn't have to be proven loyalty. I feel that was accepted." (p.11)

**Codes**: developed-vs-proven-loyalty, merit-vs-familiarity, expanding-talent-pool
**Memo**: Nixon wanted "people who were loyal to him." Malek's counter: "don't assume somebody who hadn't worked for you in the past isn't loyal to you" - can be "developed loyalty; it doesn't have to be proven loyalty." Anti-sycophancy argument - loyalty through competence/service, not just past campaign work. Expands talent beyond familiar circle. Similar to Haig's argument re: Democratic lawyers.

### 4. Campaign vs. Governing Personnel
> "Too many administrations, too many administrations, get staffed by the campaign. The qualities that make for excellence in a campaign are not necessarily the same as make for excellence in governing. There are some that are similar, but for the most part they're not. [...] To govern you need, I think, people who are of a somewhat more strategic and substantive bent than you necessarily need in a campaign. Campaigns are more tactical. You have that overall campaign strategy, but then - within that - it's more tactical. In governing, I think you need a better sense of strategy and a better sense of management." (p.10-11)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-governing, tactical-vs-strategic, political-vs-managerial
**Memo**: "Too many administrations" staffed by campaign people. "Qualities that make for excellence in a campaign are not necessarily the same as make for excellence in governing." Campaign = tactical, political experience, quick reaction. Governing = strategic, substantive, managerial. Campaign loyalty ≠ governing competence. Persistent sycophancy problem - rewarding campaign loyalty with governing positions.

### 5. Making Politically-Sponsored Nominees "Sweat"
> "MK: Say you've got a spot on a regulatory commission, and they want to appoint somebody, then they're going to make that person think that they owe the Senator. And that the President in a sense had little to do with it?
> FM: Absolutely.
> MK: Is there a way that you can—launder is not the right word—where you create a process—?
> FM: Yes. You make them sweat. You make them go through a process that makes them realize the decision-maker is the President here.
> MK: What kind of process do you create for that?
> FM: Competition. It's a competitive process; it's an interview process. You just don't look at the piece of paper and sit down. You talk to them. You have to talk to others within the White House. [...] You kind of move them around. [...] And you make it clear: you're going to put this altogether, and formulate it into a decision paper for the President." (p.8)

**Codes**: competitive-process, presidential-authority, anti-patron

age, vetting
**Memo**: Political nominees make appointee think "they owe the Senator" not president. Solution: "You make them sweat" through competitive process - interviews, White House consultations, moving them around - "makes them realize the decision-maker is the President here." Anti-sycophancy to Congress/patrons by creating sycophancy to president. Redirects loyalty.

### 6. Subjugating Ego in White House
> "You have to have political sensitivity, and you have to have overall people sensitivity, in my view. [...] Secondly, you have to, I think, have a certain amount of empathy, a certain sympathy to people around you. You can't come in and throw your ego around, because your ego is going to get beat up all the time and, if you fight back too much, you're just going to make enemies. You have to be able to subjugate your ego. You have to be able to understand the needs and desires of the people around you, and be able to work in that key." (p.6)

**Codes**: ego-subjugation, empathy, political-sensitivity, service-orientation
**Memo**: White House staff need "to subjugate your ego" - can't "throw your ego around" or "fight back too much." Must "understand the needs and desires of the people around you, and be able to work in that key." Explicit sycophancy requirement - subordinating self to serve others. But framed as strategic empathy rather than blind deference.

### 7. Haldeman: Excellent but Loyalty Tested Undesirably
> "I think you have to give some credit to Bob Haldeman. Haldeman gets kind of beat up because of all the Watergate stuff, and he was kind of autocratic. But he was one hell of a Chief of Staff. I think he really understood what needed to be done, and he was a terrific boss. [...] Well, he got into difficulty because he wasn't good at the technical aspects of the job but because he was put in a position where his loyalty was tested in a very undesirable way. He was put in a position where he had to break the law in order to protect the President. Unfortunately, he did." (p.12)

**Codes**: haldeman-competence, loyalty-test, breaking-law, sycophancy-consequence
**Memo**: Malek praises Haldeman as "one hell of a Chief of Staff," "terrific boss." But "his loyalty was tested in a very undesirable way. He was put in a position where he had to break the law in order to protect the President. Unfortunately, he did." Ultimate sycophancy consequence - loyalty leading to criminality. Not technical incompetence but moral failure through excessive loyalty.

### 8. Professional Search vs. "Over the Transom"
> "What I created that was different is a professional executive search capacity within the White House. [...] But we found that most of what we had looked at in the past, and what they were doing then, was more dependent on what came in 'over the transom' through the political system. They were not clearly delineating the nature of a job, the requirements of a job, and then going out and searching through society to find the best candidates for that kind of job, to meet the criteria." (p.2)

**Codes**: professionalization, merit-search, job-criteria, BOGAAT-alternative
**Memo**: Previous system "dependent on what came in 'over the transom' through the political system" - reactive to political recommendations. Professional system: "delineating nature of a job, requirements" then "searching through society to find the best candidates." Merit vs. patronage. Anti-sycophancy through expanded search beyond political networks.

### 9. BOGAAT: "Bunch Of Guys Around A Table"
> "In an industry, there's a certain amount of what we call BOGAAT: 'Bunch Of Guys Around A Table'. Conversations where you say: 'Who do you know?' 'Well, I know so…',so-and-so. There's a certain amount of that that goes on even today but in industry they had long since gone the professional search route where you would cast a much wider net than who you knew. I felt it was essential to do that, because a lot of people wanted to come in and serve in Government, but they had to know that these positions were available, and we had to know about them." (p.2)

**Codes**: BOGAAT, who-you-know, narrow-networks, professionalization
**Memo**: BOGAAT = "Bunch Of Guys Around A Table" asking "Who do you know?" Narrow network recruitment. Industry "long since gone the professional search route" casting "wider net than who you knew." Government needed same. Anti-sycophancy = broadening beyond personal connections.

### 10. Congressional Recommendations: Sorting Real from Pro Forma
> "You give them consideration. You try to sort out the ones that are qualified from the ones that are not. You try to sort out ones that are truly of imperative importance to the Member and which are not. In some cases, they're sending you a recommendation but it's really not a recommendation; they just have to send it because a constituent wants it. In other cases, they really have what they consider to be an obligation to somebody and really are pushing harder. And, in some cases, they fervently believe this is the right person. You have to find out where they're coming from on it, and deal with it accordingly." (p.7-8)

**Codes**: congressional-recommendations, sorting-signals, constituent-service, genuine-vs-pro-forma
**Memo**: Must sort congressional recommendations by intensity: pro forma (constituent service), obligation (patron-client), or genuine belief. Different political sycophancy levels. Shows complexity of patronage - not all recommendations equal. Need to decode which matter to Member.

### 11. Multiple Constituencies Creating Pressure
> "In business, you have to satisfy a CEO [chief executive officer] and, through the CEO, the board of directors. In government, you've got to satisfy - if you're in the White House - the Chief of Staff and the President, but you also have to take into account and satisfy to a certain extent the Congress, the members of Congress who have an interest in the area that you're in. You've got other political figures who you have to take into consideration, various constituent and interest groups, whose impact is going to be felt; and you have to take into consideration their point-of-view, and how to deal with them. So you have a much more complex array of people, whose needs have to be met." (p.7)

**Codes**: multiple-constituencies, competing-pressures, complexity
**Memo**: Government = "much more complex array of people, whose needs have to be met" - Chief of Staff, President, Congress, political figures, interest groups. Multiple masters = multiple sycophancy demands. Can't just serve president - must navigate competing loyalties. Antecedent: democratic system. Consequence: compromises, complexity.

### 12. Leaking and Premature Visibility
> "MK: One of the things, I guess, that you don't have so much of in business [as in Government]—but even there I guess you have today—is the battling out of forces, doing their public battle; this side leaking this, and that side leaking that.
> FM: Yes
> MK: Is that one of the major sources of frustration?
> FM: Absolutely. Particularly, a lot of things come out and get visibility before you really expect them to, or want them to. Then you have to deal with things prematurely. That is not helpful. That can be hurtful to the process." (p.7)

**Codes**: leaking, premature-disclosure, internal-battles, frustration
**Memo**: Leaking as major frustration - "things come out and get visibility before you really expect them to, or want them to." Have to "deal with things prematurely." Similar to Haig's point about staff leaking to impress press. Sycophancy to press/factions competes with loyalty to process/president.

### 13. Staying on Plan vs. Bending to Please Everybody
> "Supporting their decisions, making it clear he's going to support their decisions versus the competing interests of the body politic, not bending to try to please everybody. Again, I guess a final thing would be to stay on plan; develop a set of objectives and a plan and stay on it. Don't get distracted from it. Don't get distracted from it because it might be politically advantageous to do this right now because the political advantage you gain today is going to be lost six months from now when you're paying the price for having the wrong person in the job. Get the right people. You can't be totally oblivious to the political process. Obviously you have to pay attention to it, but get the right people in place. Otherwise, you're going to get killed." (p.13)

**Codes**: staying-on-plan, not-pleasing-everybody, long-term-vs-short-term, discipline
**Memo**: President must support personnel decisions "versus the competing interests of the body politic, not bending to try to please everybody." "Stay on plan" - don't get "distracted because it might be politically advantageous to do this right now because the political advantage you gain today is going to be lost six months from now when you're paying the price for having the wrong person in the job." Anti-sycophancy to political pressures. Long-term competence over short-term political gain.

### 14. Process Discipline and No Bypassing Chief
> "MK: Part of what needs to be done, say for the chief of staff and the kind of support you're talking about, is making sure that there's a process that has discipline and that a president is committed to the chief of staff to not let people bypass him, bypass the chief—
> FM: Yes.
> MK: —and he supports the chief. So whenever anybody comes to the president with something, the president says go to the chief; got to go through a process.
> FM: Yes." (p.13)

**Codes**: process-discipline, no-bypassing, chief-support, structure
**Memo**: President must support process - "not let people bypass" chief of staff. "Whenever anybody comes to the president with something, the president says go to the chief; got to go through a process." Structural anti-sycophancy - prevents end-runs, maintains hierarchy. But also enables sycophancy to CoS if CoS becomes gatekeeper with own agenda (cf. Haig on Reagan CoS).

### 15. Career People as Learning Resource
> "MK: Isn't that a tough thing and a persistent problem that people come into a White House and think that everybody in the Federal government is their enemy?
> FM: Yes.
> MK: And it takes them a long time to recognize what a resource OMB is, and career people.
> FM: Right.
> MK: How do those lessons get learned? Is it just one event at a time or one incident at a time when they learn?
> FM: It's one incident at a time adding up to an aggregate that provides him with a sense of comfort." (p.11)

**Codes**: career-professionals, initial-distrust, learning-curve, resource-recognition
**Memo**: "Persistent problem that people come into a White House and think that everybody in the Federal government is their enemy." Takes time to "recognize what a resource OMB is, and career people." Learn through "one incident at a time adding up" to "sense of comfort." Antecedent: campaign mentality, us-vs-them. Shows sycophancy can be to ideology (loyalty test) vs. pragmatism (using expertise).

### 16. Personnel as Reactive vs. Proactive
> "MK: Did they want it because they thought that things had not gone well before that, and they needed to do something that was more expansive, professional or whatever?
> FM: Yes. I think they believed that the Personnel Office, while there were some skilled people there, was a little more reactive than proactive and probably not as—it could have been better managed." (p.12)

**Codes**: reactive-vs-proactive, professionalization, management
**Memo**: Previous Personnel Office "a little more reactive than proactive" - responding to recommendations rather than actively searching. Professionalization = proactive merit search. Reactive system = captured by political recommendations = sycophancy to patronage. Proactive = service to competence.

### 17. Qualities for White House Staff: Indefatigability
> "You have to be indefatigable. It's very hard work. The Government works harder than the private sector, without question. [...] The hours, the demands, the pressures, the frustrations you experience—are greater. So, the anguish factor as well as the demands on one's time, and the pressures, are greater in high-level governmental positions, than they are in the private sector." (p.6)

**Codes**: hard-work, anguish-factor, demands, pressure
**Memo**: "Government works harder than the private sector, without question." "Anguish factor as well as the demands on one's time, and the pressures, are greater." Creates vulnerability to burnout (cf. Haig, Griscom). Extreme demands can break down resistance to sycophancy - easier to just comply when exhausted.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Comfort vs. Competence**: Secretaries recommending "someone who the Secretary just happened to know a long time, and felt comfortable with" over most qualified
2. **Developed vs. Proven Loyalty**: "Don't assume somebody who hadn't worked for you in the past isn't loyal to you" - can develop loyalty through service
3. **Campaign vs. Governing**: "Qualities that make for excellence in a campaign are not necessarily the same as make for excellence in governing"
4. **Complementary vs. Mirror Staffing**: Finding people who "shore them up" rather than reflect them
5. **Making Nominees Sweat**: Competitive process to make politically-sponsored nominees "realize the decision-maker is the President here"
6. **BOGAAT Avoidance**: Moving beyond "Bunch Of Guys Around A Table" / "who you know" to professional search
7. **Subjugating Ego**: "Can't throw your ego around" - must "understand the needs and desires of the people around you"
8. **Haldeman's Loyalty Test**: "Put in a position where he had to break the law in order to protect the President. Unfortunately, he did."
9. **Staying on Plan**: Not "bending to try to please everybody" - long-term competence over short-term political gain
10. **Multiple Constituencies**: "Much more complex array of people, whose needs have to be met" - competing sycophancy demands

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Personal relationships/familiarity with Secretary
- Campaign loyalty culture
- Political patronage system ("over the transom")
- BOGAAT networks - "who you know"
- Narrow talent pools from political circles
- Congressional patron-client relationships
- Multiple constituencies creating competing pressures

**Manifestations**:
- Secretaries recommending comfortable vs. qualified people
- Campaign staff expecting governing positions
- "Proven loyalty" demands over competence
- Congressional recommendations creating loyalty to Member
- Reactive personnel system captured by political recommendations
- Ego-driven behavior vs. subjugation
- Haldeman breaking law to protect president

**Consequences**:
- Suboptimal appointments ("compromises")
- Wrong people in jobs
- "Political advantage you gain today...lost six months from now when you're paying the price for having the wrong person"
- Watergate (Haldeman's excessive loyalty)
- Ineffective governance from campaign people in wrong roles

**Protective Factors / Anti-Sycophancy**:
- Professional executive search expanding beyond political networks
- "Developed loyalty" concept - loyalty through competence/service not just past work
- Complementary staffing - finding people who shore up weaknesses
- Competitive process making nominees "sweat" to redirect loyalty to president
- Job criteria and merit-based selection
- Staying on plan vs. bending to political pressures
- Process discipline (no bypassing chief)
- Recognizing career professionals as resources
- Strategic vs. tactical orientation for governing
