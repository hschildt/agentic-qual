# William J. Clinton Transition - Bob Nash Interview
**Date**: September 1, 2000
**Interviewee**: Bob J. Nash (Director, Office of Presidential Personnel, 1995-2000)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar with Terry Sullivan

## Document Summary
Nash provides extensive operational detail on the Presidential Personnel Office mechanics - vetting processes, database management, Hill relations, daily rhythms. Key sycophancy-relevant themes: strong defense of campaign workers as mission-committed (not just loyal hacks), intentional avoidance of contribution reports, balancing multiple competing criteria in appointments, lack of backward reflection, and Clinton's directive for "capable, competent people who believe in what I'm trying to do" plus diversity. Mostly procedural interview with limited sycophancy content beyond campaign/governing tension.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Campaign Workers = Commitment, Not Just Loyalty
> "There is an assumption on the part of a lot of people that if somebody helps in the campaign, that they're automatically a political hack and not qualified to help govern. There are some people like that, but there are some that are not. But people tend to throw that blanket over all people. It's wrong... I think when you run a campaign and you tell the American people you're going to do something, they vote for you largely based upon the future—not the past—that you said you're going to do this. And people who help you do that are people working the campaign, which means they're probably committed to it. A lot of them are not paid. They do it because they believe in you. Some of them are capable and competent and can manage, and some are not. Part of the job of personnel is to decide which one is what." (p.16-17)

> "When a candidate runs for office, they talk about positions and policies and their vision. If you worked in the campaign, nine times out of ten, you didn't work in the campaign for a salary, because they don't pay money. The ones who got paid didn't get paid much, and a lot of them volunteer. So you have some passion for what this candidate is saying. If you have that passion in a campaign, if you go to work in a particular position, you're hopefully going to carry that same passion in trying to carry out this president's vision and mission. That's what political appointees do." (p.17-18)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-governing, commitment-not-hack, mission-alignment, passion-for-vision, competence-sorting, anti-stereotype
**Memo**: Nash strongly pushes back against "political hack" assumption about campaign workers. Distinguishes between: (1) hacks who are incompetent, (2) committed competent people who share vision. "Part of the job of personnel is to decide which one is what" = sorting function, not blanket loyalty rewards. Campaign work signals "passion" and "commitment" to presidential vision - this is mission alignment, not sycophantic compliance. "Political appointees" exist to "carry out this president's vision" = legitimate role differentiation from career staff. Two equally qualified candidates: chooses campaign worker because "level of commitment and belief in this particular candidate's program." Anti-sycophancy: explicit competence requirement. Pro-mission: values shared vision. Different from blind personal loyalty.

### 2. Presidential Directive - Competence + Commitment + Diversity
> "He said, 'I want you to find capable, competent people who believe in what I'm trying to do for this country, and I want it to look like America.' That's what he said, just about that short. I got that. I understand what that means. That's what he said." (p.27)

**Codes**: presidential-directive, competence-requirement, belief-in-vision, diversity-mandate, mission-clarity
**Memo**: Clinton's instruction to Nash has THREE elements: (1) capable/competent = skill requirement, (2) "believe in what I'm trying to do" = commitment to agenda not personal loyalty, (3) "look like America" = diversity. NOT "find people loyal to me." Mission-oriented staffing. "Believe in what I'm trying to do for this country" = policy alignment. Contrast to pure personal devotion. Nash: "I got that. I understand what that means." = clear mandate requiring balancing all three criteria. Protective factor: competence explicitly required, not optional. Diversity prevents homophily/echo chamber.

### 3. Intentionally NOT Looking at Campaign Contributions
> "I don't look at contributions reports. I make it my business not to. I think it's important for me not to look at them specifically. But I go to meetings. I see people. Anybody tries to tell me what they contributed, I don't listen. I don't listen. I intentionally don't do it. I think it's a good thing... But the fact that someone supported a candidate in one way or another should not exclude them from service. What excludes them from service is a lack of qualifications to do what they're trying to do." (p.17)

**Codes**: avoiding-contributions, money-not-influence, competence-standard, deliberate-blindness, anti-corruption, qualification-focus
**Memo**: Nash's active anti-sycophancy practice - intentionally avoiding knowledge of who donated what. "I make it my business not to" = deliberate structural protection against money-for-positions. "Anybody tries to tell me what they contributed, I don't listen" = refusing information that could bias. Consequence: appointments based on qualifications not financial support. "What excludes them from service is a lack of qualifications" = merit standard. Shows how personnel director can create protective barriers. But note: "supported a candidate in one way or another should not exclude" = contribution doesn't disqualify, just doesn't buy position. Healthy boundary.

### 4. Long Relationship Enabling Independence
> "I've been around for a long time. For twenty years I've worked for this man, and I have a pretty good feel. It's important to have someone in this position who has a relationship with the president, who is not intimidated by whoever—except the president. You better be intimidated by the president. But other than that, then, to have some institutional knowledge." (p.16)

**Codes**: long-relationship, institutional-knowledge, independence-from-others, healthy-deference, political-memory
**Memo**: 20-year relationship as protective factor - Nash has "institutional knowledge" and isn't "intimidated by whoever—except the president." Can stand up to cabinet secretaries, senators, others because of presidential relationship. "You better be intimidated by the president" = healthy deference to elected authority, not sycophancy to other staff. Personal history enables independence from competing power centers. Similar to McLarty's friendship but Nash's is working relationship not childhood friendship. Consequence: can make tough calls, resist pressure. Antecedent: long service building trust.

### 5. Balancing Competing Criteria - "Really, Really, Really Tough"
> "All the things you have to consider—geography, race, sex, senatorial, congressional, outside groups, White House offices. All these things. You just have to sort of make sense out of it and you've got to make what you think is the best recommendation for the president and the country and the department. That's what you've got to do. And it's tough. It's really, really, really tough." (p.26)

> "A lot of times you're balancing out apples and oranges. There's really no way—I don't think there's anything that you all can do, in that process, of how you come to that recommendation... It depends on whether it's the beginning, the middle, the end, what the political situation is like, all that." (p.26)

**Codes**: multiple-criteria, balancing-act, complexity, context-dependent, best-recommendation, apples-and-oranges
**Memo**: Appointment decisions require balancing numerous competing factors - not just loyalty. Geography, race, sex, senatorial preference, congressional input, outside group pressure, White House office priorities. "What you think is the best recommendation for the president and the country and the department" = tri-part standard (president, country, department). Not just "what does president want?" Complexity means "no cookie cutter" - context-dependent judgment. Shows personnel work as professional craft requiring sophisticated balancing, not sycophantic compliance. "Really, really, really tough" = genuine difficulty, not performance. Anti-sycophancy: if it were just "pick loyalists" it wouldn't be this hard.

### 6. Cabinet Secretaries Given Choices, Not Dictated
> "We came up with a list of about ten names per PAS that were shared after going through a long, arduous process. We worked seven days a week, fourteen and sixteen hours a day. Those lists would go to the President. He'd look at them and say, 'All these are good people, share them with the Secretary.' The Secretary would look at them and the Secretary would say, 'That's the one right there I'd like to have.' That's the process." (p.13)

> "Some people—. In some cases, I know that some of the names on the list actually came from Cabinet secretaries. Some didn't. Some said, 'I kind of had a different idea.' I said, 'Well, but you need to look at this first.' We were the ones who went to meet with the Cabinet secretaries, the associate directors, and sat down with them and said, 'Here's the list. Here are the resumes.' 'Well, I don't see anybody I like.' It's a process. You're weak, you're strong. He's weak; they're strong." (p.14)

**Codes**: cabinet-choice, ten-names-list, presidential-approval-first, negotiation, power-balance, weak-vs-strong
**Memo**: System gave cabinet secretaries 10 names to choose from for sub-cabinet positions - not WH dictating. "That's the one right there I'd like to have" = cabinet choice. But WH filtered first - "long, arduous process" to develop list. Power dynamics: "You're weak, you're strong. He's weak; they're strong" = varies by person and position. Some secretaries pushed back: "I kind of had a different idea." Nash: "Well, but you need to look at this first" = negotiation not command. Contrast to Carter (Califano chose own people) and implied contrast to system where WH imposes. Middle ground: WH curates options, cabinet selects. Sycophancy dimension: if WH just wanted loyalists, wouldn't give secretaries choice. But WH still controls the menu.

### 7. No Backward Reflection - "We Don't Do a Good Job"
> "MK: Do you look back and say, 'This didn't work so well' or, 'This did work well?'
> BN: We don't do a good job of that, no... I had intentions of doing more of that. I think I've done, to be honest with you, only two times in my five years here—I went right over here to the White House conference center—one time was a Saturday morning for four hours, and one time it was during the day for a couple of hours, to look back. That was not enough. We should have done it four times a year, three or four times a year, just take a few hours." (p.25)

**Codes**: no-reflection, forward-only, perpetual-motion, missed-opportunity, institutional-amnesia, overwhelm
**Memo**: Classic White House pattern - no time for reflection. "We don't do a good job of that" = acknowledgment of failure. Only reflected twice in 5 years despite intentions. Consequence of perpetual forward motion: "we don't do a good job" of learning from experience. Antecedent: overwhelming daily demands. "We should have done it four times a year" = knows it's valuable but can't make time. When they did reflect, produced useful insights (tracking term expirations earlier). Shows how crisis-driven environment prevents systematic learning, pattern recognition. Not sycophancy directly but creates conditions where mistakes repeat, bad practices continue unchallenged because no time to assess.

### 8. Working 12-Hour Days, Saturdays - But Some Boundaries
> "We work an average of twelve hours a day. Saturday, at one time, was a regular workday for my office. And at one time, I had my senior people come in on Sunday, but I stopped that—because they were dead on Monday. So we don't come in on Sunday unless—we might now, because we're getting ready to start back up but—." (p.15)

> "Then I usually get out of here about eight or nine. Usually. Then we come in on Saturday, which is more relaxed. You don't get a chance to do much thinking. On Saturday you can do more strategy. Usually it's, like, me and Maria and four or five other people. We don't have everybody come in." (p.24)

**Codes**: long-hours, saturday-work, stopped-sunday, burnout-awareness, strategy-time, workload
**Memo**: Intense hours - average 12/day, Saturdays regular. But Nash stopped Sunday work when staff "were dead on Monday" = awareness of burnout, sustainability limits. Contrast to pure hours-competition sycophancy. Saturday = "more relaxed," time for strategic thinking vs. daily firefighting. Not heroic overwork narrative. Practical adjustment to reality. Antecedent: 25% White House staff cut means smaller personnel office (26 people vs. Bush's 39). Consequence: unsustainable workload but Nash tries to manage it. "This office needs at least thirty-five people; closer to what Bush had" = advocating for resources, not just demanding more hours. Professional boundary-setting.

### 9. Personal Touch - Signing Every Senator/Congressman Letter
> "If a senator or a congressman writes a letter [to] here, I started something that, I never let a senator's letter be signed by the signature machine... I personally sign every letter from [to] a senator or congressman. I read the letter they send in. This takes a lot of time, but it's just my style. I don't want a senator getting—now I know, very frankly, sometimes they never see the letter that goes back. Sometimes. Actually I did it one time—this is where it started. There was a senator—I won't tell you who it is—who didn't like the idea of—this is early on—a secretary machine letter. Since that time I've signed every one of them. And it could be a lot of them. I mean a lot of them." (p.23-24)

> "I'll take some home if I haven't signed them all. I do that until about seven... I'll tell you this, it has served me well. I have some tell me, 'Bob, thanks for that letter and thanks for your personal note.' It has served me very well, even when it's bad news." (p.24)

**Codes**: personal-touch, relationship-building, time-investment, hand-signing, respect, strategic-service
**Memo**: Nash's practice of personally signing/reading every congressional letter with handwritten notes. Started when one senator objected to machine signature. "This takes a lot of time" but "has served me well." This is relationship investment, not sycophancy - even "when it's bad news" senators appreciate personal touch. Strategic service: builds trust for future negotiations. Contrast to performative sycophancy or delegating to staff. Nash takes home letters to finish. Not about pleasing superiors but about professional respect for institutional relationships. "I don't want a senator getting [machine letter]" = understanding their perspective. Also: "I read the letter they send in" = actually engaging with content, not going through motions.

### 10. President Doesn't Call Much - "I Know What to Do"
> "MK: How often do you talk to him and what kinds of things has he told you beyond that, about recruiting and about appointments?
> BN: I don't talk to him that much. I know what to do. He knows I know what to do. Beyond that, he really hasn't said a lot. He may have expounded on it a few times, like the comment about interviewing people I recommend to him. He just wants me to—from time to time, 'We need to get these done faster. Why is that person in vetting so long? We need to get more of these folks confirmed.' That kind of stuff from time to time, sort of taking off." (p.27)

**Codes**: minimal-presidential-contact, trust-based, operational-autonomy, occasional-pressure, competence-assumed
**Memo**: Nash rarely talks to Clinton - "I know what to do. He knows I know what to do." Relationship based on trust and competence, not constant checking/approval. When Clinton does weigh in: operational concerns (speed, vetting delays, confirmations) not personnel choices. One substantive comment: told Nash to interview every full-time PAS he recommends (after approving someone Nash hadn't met). Anti-sycophancy: autonomy based on competence/trust, not needing constant validation. Not micromanaged. Consequence: Nash has discretion to make professional judgments within presidential directive. Contrast to needy or controlling presidents who want involvement in every decision. Long relationship enables this autonomy.

### 11. Chief of Staff Variations - "It Varies"
> "MK: What about the chief of staff? What kinds of dealings do you have with them and has it varied among the various chiefs you've dealt with?
> BN: It varies with the chief of staff... For the most part, they get the memo. But if there is something that I think is important—sometimes at a senior staff meeting I might say something about a particular search... Or I might do a separate memo, not the decision memo but something else, that says, 'I've got a situation where Senator X wants a person for this position and Senator Y wants a person for this position. I know you may be up on the Hill from time to time and you may hear about this, so I want you to know what the situation is.'" (p.28)

**Codes**: chief-variation, memo-flow, heads-up-communication, context-provision, not-micromanaged
**Memo**: Nash's relationship with chiefs of staff (Panetta, Bowles, Podesta) varies but generally = memos go through COS office to president, occasional heads-up on sensitive situations. "For the most part, they get the memo" = not meeting regularly to discuss. Nash initiates communication when he thinks COS needs to know (competing senators, potential problems). "You always want to have them with you... You don't want them to be surprised." Protective factor: keeping COS informed prevents being undercut. But "they've all been very great and very good with me" = no interference. Decision memos go daily, COS sends to president, Nash gets them back daily. System working smoothly. Not sycophantic relationship - professional coordination.

### 12. Interviewing Full-Time PAS Candidates
> "One time the President said to me that was a great—he had approved this full-time PAS. He said, 'That was a great recommendation you made on whoever. Didn't you like him?' I said, 'Mr. President, I didn't meet him.' He said, 'Don't recommend to me anybody that you don't meet.' From that day forward—what he meant was, not like people for a board that meets four times a year—but I interviewed every full-time PAS. It takes a lot of time." (p.9)

**Codes**: presidential-directive, interview-requirement, quality-control, time-investment, personal-vetting
**Memo**: Clinton told Nash to interview every full-time PAS before recommending - quality control mechanism. Nash complied: "From that day forward... I interviewed every full-time PAS. It takes a lot of time." Anti-sycophancy through direct assessment - can't just rely on paper credentials or others' recommendations. Must form own judgment before recommending to president. Consequence: Nash has firsthand knowledge of who he's proposing. Protective factor: personal interview reveals things resume doesn't. Shows presidential expectation of thoroughness, not just filling slots. "It takes a lot of time" but Nash does it - professionalism over efficiency.

## Limited Sycophancy Analysis

This interview is **primarily operational** - focused on mechanics of personnel process (databases, vetting stages, Hill relations, daily rhythms). Much more procedural than most transition interviews.

**Key Anti-Sycophancy Points**:

1. **Campaign ≠ Hack**: Nash's strong defense of campaign workers as mission-committed, not political hacks. "Part of the job of personnel is to decide which one is what" = sorting competent from incompetent, not rewarding all loyalists.

2. **Avoiding Contribution Information**: Intentionally doesn't look at who donated what. "What excludes them from service is a lack of qualifications."

3. **Competence in Presidential Directive**: Clinton's instruction = "capable, competent people who believe in what I'm trying to do" + diversity. NOT "loyal people."

4. **Complex Balancing**: Must weigh geography, race, sex, senators, congress, groups, WH offices. "Really, really, really tough." Not simple loyalty test.

5. **Cabinet Choice**: 10-name lists allowing secretaries to select, not WH dictating.

**Sycophancy-Enabling Factors**:

1. **No Reflection**: Only looked back twice in 5 years. Perpetual forward motion prevents learning.

2. **Overwhelming Workload**: 12-hour days, Saturdays regular. But Nash stopped Sundays when staff "were dead on Monday" = some boundaries.

3. **Campaign Preference**: Two equally qualified candidates, Nash chooses campaign worker for "passion" and "commitment." Mission alignment but creates advantage for early loyalists.

**Process Integrity**:

- Hand-signing senator/congressman letters with personal notes
- Interviewing every full-time PAS candidate
- Standing up for rational vetting requirements (pushing back on unnecessary financial statements)
- Keeping detailed time-tracking data
- Building relationships with Hill through regular visits

**Unique Insights**:

- 190,000 resumes in database but most never used
- Half the time from initiation to confirmation is AFTER nomination (confirmation process)
- 75-78% average confirmation rate normally, only 41% in election year 1996
- Smallest personnel office in recent history (26 people) due to 25% WH staff cut
- "Three-letter blowup system" for people who don't return vetting forms

**Note**: This interview provides valuable operational detail about HOW personnel process works but limited insight into sycophancy dynamics compared to policy-focused interviews. Nash comes across as professional, process-oriented, relationship-focused but not sycophantic. His long relationship with Clinton enables independence from other power centers while maintaining healthy deference to president.
