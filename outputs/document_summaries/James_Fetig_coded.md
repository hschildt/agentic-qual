# William J. Clinton Transition - James Fetig Interview
**Date**: February 2, 1999
**Interviewee**: James Fetig (NSC Press Office representative, 1995-1997)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Fetig provides extraordinarily detailed operational description of NSC Press Office daily mechanics - press guidance preparation, daily conference calls, briefing coordination, reporter relations, travel. Served April 1995 - January 1997 as army colonel detailed to NSC. Very limited sycophancy-relevant content. Main themes: Clinton administration "focused on wrong things" (TV appearance over substance), "kiddie corps" reputation vs. experienced NSC press staff, egalitarian but messy decision-making, no formal preparation/materials, professional autonomy ("hired for your judgment"), and altruistic decision-making focus on "what's right for republic."

## Limited Sycophancy-Relevant Excerpts

### 1. Focus on "Wrong Things" - Appearance Over Substance
> "There was a hang-up for a while, on whether or not I would be good on TV. I found in this [Clinton] administration, they tended to focus on a lot of what I considered to be the wrong things. The question was whether you had any substance. You didn't have to go on television; Mike McCurry did that. The question was whether you could get the right answers. Get the government coordinated to act with a single voice, and [search] out the flaws in policies or the primary questions that the press would focus on, get some straight answers and respond." (p.2)

**Codes**: wrong-priorities, appearance-over-substance, tv-focus, superficial-criteria, competence-vs-performance
**Memo**: Fetig critiques Clinton administration tendency to prioritize "whether or not I would be good on TV" over substance/competence. "I considered to be the wrong things" = explicit criticism of misplaced priorities. Real job: get right answers, coordinate government, respond to press - not perform on television. McCurry did TV; Fetig's role was backend substance. Sycophancy dimension: focusing on how staff perform/look rather than what they can do = performative rather than competence-based evaluation. Shows how image-consciousness can distort personnel decisions.

### 2. "Kiddie Corps" Reputation BUT Experienced NSC Press Office
> "The Clinton White House was noted for its kiddie corps, particularly young staffers, but everybody in the National Security press office had gray hair. There were no unseasoned people. Tom Ross was over sixty years old. He had been Harold Brown's Pentagon spokesman, years before. He had long service as a newspaperman and as a senior corporate public relations official with General Electric, RCA [inaudible] and he wanted to do one more stint in public service. That's why he was there. I was a full colonel in the U.S. army. Calvin Mitchell was a foreign service officer as was David Johnson. We were not inexperienced people. We knew what we did not know which was very important." (p.14)

**Codes**: kiddie-corps-reputation, gray-hair-contrast, experience-matters, knew-what-not-knew, professional-competence, nsc-exception
**Memo**: Important contrast - WH "noted for its kiddie corps" BUT NSC press office had only experienced, seasoned professionals. "Everybody...had gray hair. There were no unseasoned people." Ross 60+ years old, Fetig full colonel, Mitchell/Johnson foreign service officers. "We knew what we did not know" = professional self-awareness vs. youthful overconfidence. Shows NSC press learned from rest of WH's mistakes - didn't hire inexperienced campaign people for critical press function. Protective factor: experience requirement. Anti-sycophancy: competence over youth/loyalty. Exception that proves rule about Clinton "kiddie corps."

### 3. Egalitarian But Messy Decision-Making
> "There's a line in Colin Powell's book, where he described National Security Council meetings as graduate school bull sessions. I saw a certain amount of that when I was there. It was messy because it was egalitarian in a lot of ways. A lot of people could have a voice. That's the way they wanted it, and that's their privilege. My purpose was not to judge that." (p.16)

**Codes**: graduate-school-bull-sessions, egalitarian-decision-making, messy-process, multiple-voices, powell-critique
**Memo**: Colin Powell's characterization: NSC meetings = "graduate school bull sessions." Fetig confirms: "I saw a certain amount of that." Cause: "egalitarian in a lot of ways. A lot of people could have a voice." Not hierarchical/disciplined. "Messy" = lack of structure. Fetig neutral: "that's their privilege. My purpose was not to judge that." Sycophancy dimension: egalitarianism can be anti-hierarchical (good) or undisciplined (bad). Multiple voices = inclusive but inefficient. Contrast to Reagan/Bush more structured NSC. Neither pure sycophancy nor pure anti-sycophancy - depends on execution.

### 4. Professional Autonomy - "Hired for Your Judgment"
> "MK: When people called and you called them back, you were authorized to provide answers?
> JF: Absolutely.
> MK: You didn't have to check with anybody.
> JF: No. You're authorized to do anything. You're a pretty senior member of the government, but you're also required to do the right thing. So you're hired for your judgment. It was sort of interesting." (p.13-14)

**Codes**: professional-autonomy, hired-for-judgment, authorized-independently, do-right-thing, senior-responsibility, trust-based
**Memo**: Fetig had complete authority to speak for administration without checking with superiors. "You're authorized to do anything... you're hired for your judgment." Trusted professional autonomy. "Required to do the right thing" = responsibility not compliance. "Pretty senior member of the government" = recognition of role. Anti-sycophancy: no need to check every answer with boss. Professional discretion within guidelines. Antecedent: experienced staff (previous excerpt). Consequence: responsive, effective press operation. Contrast to micromanagement or requiring approval for every statement. Trust-based system.

### 5. Altruistic Decision-Making - "What's Right for the Republic?"
> "The most interesting thing that I've noticed, I didn't see anybody treating it lightly. I saw a lot of politics fall away when decisions were being made on behalf of the United States of America and all of its citizens. Very often, you'd hear the question: 'What's the right thing for the republic?' as opposed to, 'What 's the right thing for our party?' or, 'What's the right thing…?' for some other reason. There's an altruism that goes with that, that's worth experiencing." (p.25)

**Codes**: altruism, republic-over-party, right-thing, politics-fall-away, higher-purpose, anti-partisanship
**Memo**: Fetig observes decision-makers asking "'What's the right thing for the republic?' as opposed to, 'What's the right thing for our party?'" Politics "fall away when decisions were being made on behalf of the United States of America and all of its citizens." "Altruism" = serving larger cause than self or party. Anti-sycophancy: prioritizing national interest over political advantage or presidential preferences. "Nobody treating it lightly" = seriousness of responsibility. Protective factor: higher purpose orientation. Idealistic observation - may reflect Fetig's perspective as military officer (country over politics) more than universal WH culture. But suggests mission-focus over sycophantic compliance.

### 6. No Preparation - Created Own "Brain Book"
> "MK: Did you have anything to read? Did they give you any kind of briefing books about White House operations, press operations or anything?
> JF: No, ma'am, they did not. That would have been something extremely helpful. Now what I did was: I put one together. In fact, it sits right over there. I could even tell you what's in it.
> MK: Could you xerox it for me?
> JF: Well, I'm not sure how much good that would be. I put together a brain book." (p.19)

**Codes**: no-preparation, brain-book, self-created-resources, institutional-gap, learning-by-doing
**Memo**: Zero formal preparation/briefing materials. "No, ma'am, they did not. That would have been something extremely helpful." Fetig created own "brain book" - phone lists, duty officer instructions, press tong lists, NSC calendar, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. Gathered information "wherever I could find it." Not sycophancy issue directly but shows lack of institutional knowledge transfer, everyone reinventing wheel. Consequence: steep learning curve, inefficiency. "It took about six months before I started feeling comfortable. It took almost a year before I felt I had my hands really wrapped around the issues." Lack of preparation = vulnerability, mistakes, slower effectiveness.

## Operational Detail (Non-Sycophancy Content)

This interview is **95% operational mechanics**:
- Daily rhythms: 6:30am start, reading papers, preparing news summary for Tony Lake's 7:30 staff meeting
- Press guidance process: coordinating State, Pentagon, CIA positions on daily conference call
- Briefing prep: murder boards, background vs. on-record, diplo-speak shorthand
- Reporter relations: 70 calls/day average, hundreds on crisis days
- Travel: regional portfolio division (Fetig: Europe, Latin America, Asia)
- Long hours: home 9-9:30pm, calls during night, 4-5 hours sleep average
- "Brain book" contents: booth numbers, all-call beeper, fax numbers, Taiwan Relations Act, NSC staff directory, voice mail instructions, op-ed contact lists, etc.

## Limited Sycophancy Analysis

**Very limited sycophancy content** - primarily operational/procedural interview about press office mechanics.

**Key Points**:

1. **Critique of Priorities**: Administration focused on "wrong things" (TV appearance) over substance (getting right answers)

2. **Experience Exception**: Despite "kiddie corps" reputation, NSC press office hired only seasoned professionals. "We knew what we did not know."

3. **Professional Autonomy**: "Hired for your judgment" - complete authority to speak without checking with superiors

4. **Altruistic Decision-Making**: Observed "what's right for republic?" asked more than "what's right for our party?"

5. **Egalitarian Process**: Powell's "graduate school bull sessions" - inclusive but messy. Not hierarchical.

6. **Advocate Role Clarity**: Fetig tells reporters "I'm an advocate for the Administration... My job is to help the administration tell its story in the most favorable way possible. Don't forget that." Professional clarity about spin vs. journalism.

**Not Sycophancy-Related But Interesting**:
- Extreme detail on press office operations (most detailed in all interviews)
- No formal preparation/transition materials
- Created own "brain book" reference guide
- Physical toll: lack of sleep, constant phone calls, long hours, burnout
- "When people say they leave to spend more time with their family, they're generally not lying; they're telling you the absolute truth."

**Recommendation**: This interview is highly valuable for understanding NSC press office operations but has minimal sycophancy content. Brief mention in final analysis, focus on:
1. TV appearance over substance critique
2. "Kiddie corps" vs. experienced NSC press contrast
3. Professional autonomy ("hired for judgment")
4. Altruistic decision-making observations
