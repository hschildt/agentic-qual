# Richard M. Nixon / Gerald Ford Transitions - Alexander M. Haig, Jr. Interview
**Date**: December 22, 1999
**Interviewee**: Alexander M. Haig, Jr. (Chief of Staff to Nixon and Ford)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Haig discusses serving as Chief of Staff during Watergate crisis and Ford transition. Major themes include: staff leaking to impress press, Kennedy's system where task forces "always fed him back what he wanted to hear," the need for non-sycophants who speak up, chief of staff as "faceless" facilitator vs. having own agenda, campaign vs. governing personnel, Eisenhower's formalized system vs. Kennedy/Johnson's ad hoc approaches, and burnout from crisis management. Explicitly uses term "sycophants" and discusses protection from yes-men.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Staff Self-Aggrandizement Through Press Leaks
> "There was an unusual hemorrhaging to the press during Watergate. Unfortunately, in addition to the disloyal, there were a lot of people also trying to impress the press with how much they were in-the-know. That's a tendency in every administration, but it really got out of hand during Watergate." (p.1)

**Codes**: press-leaking, self-importance, impressing-outsiders, disloyalty
**Memo**: Staff leaked to demonstrate insider status - form of self-promotion rather than service. "That's a tendency in every administration" - sycophancy to press (impressing them) competes with sycophancy to president (serving loyally). Antecedent: Watergate crisis amplified normal tendency. Consequence: undermined president.

### 2. Reagan Chief of Staff as Primary Leaker
> "We've had a White House chief of staff, who will remain unnamed, who was the primary source during the Reagan administration, for almost everything. That was his style. Most of it was factually wrong but the press, having been given this information from a very high level, would write it as the gospel. And it wasn't right because it was always twisted to serve the purposes of the giver. That's what I call an individual utilizing his own position, or that of someone that he was supporting, to further his own agenda." (p.1)

**Codes**: chief-of-staff-agenda, media-manipulation, self-promotion, distorting-truth
**Memo**: Unnamed Reagan CoS (likely Don Regan based on context) leaked extensively, twisting information "to serve purposes of the giver" and "further his own agenda." Classic sycophancy problem - using position for self rather than serving president. Press became "accomplice, because it produces good print." Bidirectional corruption.

### 3. Kennedy's System: Always Told Him What He Wanted to Hear
> "The Kennedy system was ad hoc and characterized by an anti-organizational bias. Whether it was in foreign affairs or domestic affairs, he set up his own little task forces, the mafia, and they always fed him back what he wanted to hear. So, when he went wrong, he went very wrong." (p.12)

**Codes**: yes-men, task-forces, feedback-loop, catastrophic-failure, kennedy-model
**Memo**: Kennedy's "Irish mafia" task force system "always fed him back what he wanted to hear." Result: "when he went wrong, he went very wrong." Perfect illustration of sycophancy consequence - no correction mechanism. Antecedent: ad hoc, informal structure. Consequence: unchecked errors.

### 4. Kennedy's Political Appointees: Guaranteed Right Answer
> "President Kennedy put his political appointees at every key junction box in the bureaucracy, so that when he wanted to do something he merely asked the bureaucracy, and was almost guaranteed to get the answer he wanted. You know what I mean? Now, that gave him a lot of discipline and a lot of ability to move quickly into controversial new policies, but it also took away his protection from mistakes, because it deprived him of historic memory." (p.7)

**Codes**: political-appointees, guaranteed-compliance, institutional-memory-loss, protection-from-mistakes
**Memo**: Kennedy "almost guaranteed to get the answer he wanted" by placing loyalists at every junction. Haig explicitly notes trade-off: discipline/speed vs. "protection from mistakes" and "historic memory." Sycophantic system = responsive but error-prone. Career professionals provide protective dissent that political appointees don't.

### 5. Cabinet Officers Implementing Policy as They Want
> "If a cabinet officer came over to one of these breakfasts, or so-called weekly luncheons, the president would sit there and say, 'I want to do a, b, c and d. Now boys, go back to work.' They'd all go back and tell their departments, and slant the decision in the direction towards what they thought their department wanted them to move to enhance their position in their own department or to come closer to their own personal viewpoint." (p.12)

**Codes**: departmental-distortion, selective-implementation, institutional-sycophancy, policy-slanting
**Memo**: Without written decisions, cabinet officers "slant the decision" toward what their department wanted or their "own personal viewpoint." Each department thinks "What a great cabinet officer we've got; he wins every battle." Inverse sycophancy - serving department over president. Consequence: incoherent policy, each agency getting different instructions.

### 6. Eisenhower Cabinet Cabals: Philosophically Impure Compromises
> "Unfortunately, what often happened during the Eisenhower period was that it was somewhat over-formalized. So what the various departments did was form a cabal of cabinet officers who would send up strawmen actions, but also a compromise option that had something in it for every member of the cabal. Thus, the solution that made sense had no philosophic integrity. It had no cutting edge." (p.12)

**Codes**: cabinet-cabal, bureaucratic-compromise, philosophical-dilution, strawman-options
**Memo**: Overly formal system led to cabinet cabals creating compromise options "that had something in it for every member" - lost "philosophic integrity" and "cutting edge." Bureaucratic sycophancy - presenting options that please all bureaucratic actors rather than best serve president/policy. Shows formality alone doesn't prevent sycophancy.

### 7. Chief of Staff Must Not Be Sycophant
> "MK: In a White House is that difficult to do—
> AH: —of course. One way is to attract people to work in the Executive branch who are not sycophants and who will speak up when they disagree.
> MK: —when you have such a fast pace?
> AH: Absolutely." (p.16)

**Codes**: anti-sycophancy-principle, speaking-up, disagreement-value, recruitment
**Memo**: Haig explicitly uses term "sycophants" - need people "who will speak up when they disagree." Acknowledges it's difficult in fast-paced environment. Anti-sycophancy as deliberate recruitment strategy. Must actively seek people willing to dissent.

### 8. Chief of Staff as Faceless Facilitator vs. Own Agenda
> "A chief of staff must view himself, first as a faceless intimate of the president. Faceless. He should seldom talk to the press. He should have little or no public profile. He should be viewed by the Cabinet and the counselors to the president as a transmission belt, as a facilitator of their communication with the president. Never an obstacle; never as an individual with his own agenda. President Reagan never understood this and it hurt him, despite his remarkable personal attributes." (p.9)

**Codes**: faceless-service, transmission-belt, no-own-agenda, reagan-failure, facilitator-role
**Memo**: Ideal chief of staff = "faceless intimate," "transmission belt," "facilitator" - "Never an obstacle; never as an individual with his own agenda." Reagan "never understood this and it hurt him." Clear anti-sycophancy ideal - selfless service without personal ambition. Contrast to unnamed Reagan CoS (excerpt 2) who had own agenda.

### 9. Chief of Staff Viewed as Ally, Not Roadblock
> "The big challenge is making associates feel you are serving their purposes and their concerns and their substantive worries and they can get through. The worst outcome is if they believe you are a roadblock and have your own agenda." (p.18)

**Codes**: facilitator-vs-gatekeeper, service-orientation, avoiding-agenda-perception
**Memo**: Worst outcome = cabinet thinks you "are a roadblock and have your own agenda." Must make them feel you're "serving their purposes." Paradox of anti-sycophancy: serve president by facilitating others' access, not by controlling/filtering. True service looks like enabling rather than gatekeeping.

### 10. Campaign People vs. Governing People
> "Another lesson that surfaces is that presidents, newly elected presidents, can't seem to grasp that it takes one kind of person to get you elected, and another kind of person to help you govern once you are elected. In this wonderful country of ours, you can also take care of those you owe political debts of gratitude. There are plenty of jobs that are suited for them. But if you make them Secretary of State, or Secretary of the Treasury, or Defense, watch out. You're going to make profound mistakes; and you deprive yourself and the country of protection." (p.7)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-governing, political-debt, expertise-vs-loyalty, protection-from-mistakes
**Memo**: Campaign people ≠ governing people. Can reward loyalists in appropriate positions, but putting them in Cabinet = "profound mistakes" and loss of "protection." Campaign loyalty (sycophancy) shouldn't trump competence for major positions. Protection requires expertise that can disagree, not just loyalty.

### 11. Political Litmus Test vs. Expertise
> "But if you become paranoid and you view everything as a political litmus test then you're going to look for a politically compatible clone to run your agencies and appoint to cabinet positions. If you recognize that government is serious business and it's highly substantive, and you must have experience, then you're going to lean the other way, and you're going to achieve more, in my view." (p.8)

**Codes**: paranoia, political-litmus-test, clone-seeking, expertise-vs-ideology
**Memo**: Paranoia leads to seeking "politically compatible clone" for all positions. Alternative: recognize "government is serious business" requiring experience/expertise. Clone-seeking = sycophancy-by-selection. Antecedent: paranoia (Haig noted Nixon's paranoia re: Democratic lawyers). Consequence: incompetence, loss of protection.

### 12. Nixon's Paranoid Refusal of Democratic Lawyers
> "I tried to get him to hire [Edward] Bennett Williams, a top Democratic lawyer. I said what a smart Republican does is hire a smart Democratic lawyer, who is plugged in to the Democratic establishment. The President simply wouldn't do it. However, I then tried to get him to hire Joe Califano, also a Democrat. He refused to do that because, he said, 'These fellows are Democrats; they'll do me in.' I said, no, they're lawyers first; they're professionals; they have been professional throughout their careers. [...] This was partisan paranoia." (p.4-5)

**Codes**: paranoia, partisan-distrust, professional-vs-political, missed-opportunity
**Memo**: Nixon facing impeachment refused top Democratic lawyers because "they'll do me in." Both (Williams, Califano) would have taken case professionally. "Partisan paranoia" - extreme version of seeking only loyalists. Califano confirmed post-Watergate he would have done it. Consequence: inadequate defense. Sycophancy through paranoid loyalty demands.

### 13. Secretary of Defense Disobeying President
> "We had problems. The then-Secretary of Defense often failed to do what the President wanted. Sometimes he did the exact opposite and he would take his orders from the Hill, from where he had come. President Nixon became frustrated with him. I would have fired him. But Nixon wasn't constituted that way and the secretary knew it." (p.10)

**Codes**: cabinet-disloyalty, congressional-vs-presidential-loyalty, firing-reluctance, inverse-sycophancy
**Memo**: Defense Secretary "often failed to do what the President wanted. Sometimes he did the exact opposite" - took "orders from the Hill." Inverse sycophancy - secretary served Congress over president. Nixon wouldn't fire him - "secretary knew it." Antecedent: came from Hill. Consequence: presidential authority undermined. Shows sycophancy isn't universal - some officials resist.

### 14. Nixon/Reagan Wouldn't Fire People
> "Only in the most extreme cases would President Nixon fire anybody. As his Chief of Staff, I'd have to do the firing. But that's not uncommon with presidents, in my experience. They simply don't like to do unpolitical things and some, such as Nixon and Reagan, did not like to do it as a personal preference. [...] President Reagan was the same way. As governor of California, Reagan had to get his then-lawyer Bill Smith in to fire his housemaids. He simply didn't have the stomach to do it." (p.10)

**Codes**: firing-reluctance, delegated-dirty-work, personal-aversion, chief-of-staff-role
**Memo**: Nixon and Reagan personally reluctant to fire anyone - "didn't have the stomach." CoS had to do firing. Reagan "had to get his then-lawyer Bill Smith in to fire his housemaids." This enables sycophants/non-performers to remain. President's personal niceness creates accountability gap. Consequence: bad actors stay too long.

### 15. Zealots vs. Objective Professionals
> "Well, honest people, objective, professional people, in my view, are better at assessing whether or not things are going right or wrong and need adjustment, than are zealots. A zealot will insist he's right, notwithstanding that the whole place is collapsing." (p.17)

**Codes**: zealot-vs-professional, ideological-blindness, self-assessment, objectivity
**Memo**: Zealot = extreme sycophant to ideology - "will insist he's right, notwithstanding that the whole place is collapsing." Can't self-correct. Objective professionals better at assessment/adjustment. Sycophancy to ideology as dangerous as sycophancy to person. Need people who can see reality over loyalty to position.

### 16. Formalized Decision Memos to Prevent Departmental Distortion
> "Well, you have to write down formally what the President really decides. That's why we resurrected decision memos or written recaps of what the President actually approved. [...] If you have enough formality, so there is no doubt about your decision, and you promulgate it in writing, you ingrain the policy formulation in a more formal structure, and help to keep each department from going its own way." (p.12)

**Codes**: written-decisions, formality, preventing-distortion, decision-memos
**Memo**: Without written decisions, departments implement policy "as they each wanted it to be." Formalized decision memos prevent departmental freelancing. Anti-sycophancy mechanism - written record prevents selective interpretation. Eisenhower model. Prevents departments from telling themselves "What a great cabinet officer we've got; he wins every battle" when actually distorting president's intent.

### 17. Populist Leaders: Finger to the Wind
> "The facts are the explosion in information sciences has changed fundamentally the character of statecraft. [...] What it's created is a new kind of political leader, too, the populist; the fellow who gets up every morning, puts his finger to the wind and says, 'What's going to make me popular today?' In substantive terms, this means nothing. 'What makes me popular?' 'What builds my political base?' That's what's happening today in the White House." (p.13)

**Codes**: populism, poll-driven, popularity-seeking, substanceless-leadership
**Memo**: Information explosion created "populist" leader who asks daily "What's going to make me popular today?" - "In substantive terms, this means nothing." Sycophancy to polls/public opinion rather than principle. Contrast to Edmund Burke ideal: leaders guided by "dictates of their conscience and their experience." Modern sycophancy = serving popularity metrics.

### 18. Burnout and Extreme Hours
> "Well, your day is incredible as a White House chief of staff. I usually was in by seven and I never went home before midnight, frequently seven days a week. I did that for two years. I did the same for four years with Henry Kissinger in the National Security Council staff. [...] Sometimes it was worse because Henry used to generate his ideas at night. He would call me at one, two o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning. [...] I didn't sleep more than three or four hours a night. And I did that for seven years." (p.17-18)

**Codes**: burnout, extreme-hours, unsustainable-pace, watergate-stress
**Memo**: 7am-midnight, 7 days/week for 2 years as CoS; 4 years same with Kissinger (including 1-3am calls). 3-4 hours sleep for 7 years total. "By the time President Nixon resigned, most of the key staff were stressed to the limit, and had been for some time." Consequence of crisis: extreme demands. Creates vulnerability to errors, need for rotation.

### 19. Johnson's Gulf of Tonkin: Announcing Before Action
> "President Johnson kept calling the secretary. 'I have already announced to the American people that I have an important announcement for them.' He was scheduled to give the TV announcement at six that night. You know what he finally felt compelled to do? He actually announced the air attack before it happened, jeopardizing the lives of our pilots—who had not reached their targets." (p.14)

**Codes**: media-pressure, premature-announcement, pilot-lives-endangered, public-relations-over-safety
**Memo**: Johnson announced air strike before it occurred because he'd promised TV announcement. "Jeopardizing the lives of our pilots." Sycophancy to media/public expectations over operational security. Compression of time + need to respond publicly = dangerous decisions. Shows how external sycophancy (to media) can override sound judgment.

### 20. Kissinger's Power and Ford Staff Undercutting Him
> "I think Nixon regretted it later, because Kissinger got so powerful. Then, when President Ford arrived, his staff came in determined to cut Kissinger's power. So they took him out of the National Security Adviser position—which should have been done—but then they started undercutting Kissinger as Secretary of State. This was not a prudent thing, because Kissinger was one of the greatest assets the President had." (p.13)

**Codes**: staff-rivalry, undercutting-talent, political-maneuvering, asset-destruction
**Memo**: Ford staff "determined to cut Kissinger's power" - removed from NSA (appropriate) but then "started undercutting" as SecState (imprudent). Destroyed presidential asset due to staff politics. Shows staff can be sycophantic to their own agenda/resentments rather than president's interests. Inverse sycophancy - serving anti-Kissinger sentiment over Ford's needs.

### 21. Watergate Staff: Worried About Themselves vs. Country
> "So there was a tremendous rebuilding job that had to be done. But it was a rare person that you could go to in the private sector who would risk coming into the 'Watergate White House.' [...] Some of those still serving just found they couldn't hang around any longer when Watergate exploded. When an official finds himself worrying more about himself or herself than their obligation to the American people, you're probably better off without them anyway." (p.3)

**Codes**: self-preservation, abandonment, crisis-loyalty, duty-vs-self-interest
**Memo**: Many couldn't be recruited to "Watergate White House"; some serving "couldn't hang around." "When an official finds himself worrying more about himself or herself than their obligation to the American people, you're probably better off without them anyway." Crisis reveals who serves vs. who serves self. Anti-sycophancy = duty over self-preservation.

### 22. Staff Implementation System: Deputies Meeting
> "It doesn't take long to realize that the principals walked out of these meetings and into the maelstrom and by the end of the day hadn't done what the President wanted done. So I put a substructure together of the principals' key assistants, their deputies, or their hand-picked agents. My deputy in turn ran that meeting for me. He would sit in on the earlier principals' meeting, make notes on everything that was decided on, and then meet with the subgroup who, in turn, would and could spend all day getting the decisions implemented." (p.6)

**Codes**: implementation-structure, deputy-system, follow-through, accountability
**Memo**: Principals get consumed by "maelstrom" and don't implement president's decisions. Deputies meeting ensures follow-through. Anti-sycophancy mechanism - not enough to nod agreement at meeting, need structure ensuring action. Prevents "yes" at meeting, then departments doing what they wanted.

### 23. Bipartisan Outreach and Hearing Dissent
> "Sometimes that means bipartisanship. Sometimes it means reaching out to get an iconoclast or whatever it is you need. But be sure you're hearing both sides of every argument. Good national leaders reach out to hear dissenting viewpoints and weigh them carefully. [...] One way is to attract people to work in the Executive branch who are not sycophants and who will speak up when they disagree." (p.16)

**Codes**: bipartisanship, iconoclasts, dissenting-views, dialectical-thinking
**Memo**: "Be sure you're hearing both sides of every argument." Need iconoclasts, dissenters, non-sycophants. References dialectic (Hegel, Kant) - thesis/antithesis producing synthesis. Anti-sycophancy = actively seeking contrary views. "Good national leaders reach out to hear dissenting viewpoints and weigh them carefully."

### 24. Outside Advisory Group
> "Well, because of my set of problems during Watergate, I had legal people, constitutional lawyers, experienced political lawyers, criminal lawyers, all kinds. [...] They would come to Washington and I would seek their advice. [...] Earlier, President Nixon used a group of elder statesmen. He called them the wise men." (p.17)

**Codes**: outside-advisers, wise-men, external-perspective, watergate-counsel
**Memo**: Haig consulted diverse outside experts (legal, constitutional, political). Nixon had "wise men" - elder statesmen. External advisers provide perspective insiders lack. Anti-sycophancy strategy. Similar to Griscom's informal cross-party advisers. Protective factor: outside reality check.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Guaranteed Right Answer**: Kennedy's system where appointees "almost guaranteed to get the answer he wanted" vs. protection from mistakes
2. **Always Fed Back What He Wanted**: Kennedy task forces "always fed him back what he wanted to hear. So, when he went wrong, he went very wrong"
3. **Faceless Service vs. Own Agenda**: Ideal CoS as "transmission belt" vs. Reagan CoS with personal agenda who leaked/twisted info
4. **Sycophants vs. Speakers-Up**: Explicit need for people "who are not sycophants and who will speak up when they disagree"
5. **Political Clones vs. Expertise**: Paranoia leading to seeking "politically compatible clone" vs. recognizing need for substantive experience
6. **Campaign Loyalty vs. Governing Competence**: Can reward campaign people appropriately, but putting in major positions = "profound mistakes"
7. **Zealots vs. Professionals**: Zealot insists he's right "notwithstanding that the whole place is collapsing" vs. objective assessment
8. **Departmental Distortion**: Cabinet "slant the decision" toward what department/they wanted without written records
9. **Populism**: Leaders who ask "What makes me popular?" vs. Burke's ideal of conscience/experience
10. **Cabinet Cabals**: Compromise with "something in it for every member" losing "philosophic integrity"

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Watergate crisis creating hemorrhaging/self-promotion to press
- Paranoia creating political litmus tests, clone-seeking
- Kennedy's anti-organizational bias enabling ad hoc task forces
- Media/information explosion creating populist leaders
- Presidential reluctance to fire enabling bad actors to remain
- Congressional background (Defense Secretary) creating divided loyalty

**Manifestations**:
- Task forces that "always fed him back what he wanted to hear"
- Chief of staff with own agenda leaking/twisting information
- Political appointees guaranteeing president gets answer he wants
- Departments "slanting" decisions toward their preferences
- Cabinet cabals creating philosophically impure compromises
- Zealots insisting they're right despite collapse
- Populist "finger to the wind" leadership
- Staff leaking to impress press with insider status

**Consequences**:
- "When he went wrong, he went very wrong" (Kennedy)
- Loss of "protection from mistakes" and "historic memory"
- Reagan "never understood this and it hurt him"
- Profound mistakes from campaign people in major positions
- Incoherent policy (different agencies getting different instructions)
- Defense Secretary doing opposite of what president wanted
- Johnson endangering pilots to meet TV announcement deadline
- Ford staff destroying Kissinger asset through undercutting

**Protective Factors / Anti-Sycophancy**:
- Attract people "who are not sycophants and who will speak up"
- Formalized decision memos preventing departmental distortion
- Deputy implementation meetings ensuring follow-through
- Outside advisory groups (wise men, legal experts, iconoclasts)
- Bipartisan outreach, hearing dissenting viewpoints
- Professional expertise over political compatibility
- Written records of decisions
- Chief of staff as faceless facilitator without own agenda
- Recognizing campaign ≠ governing personnel
- Hiring Democratic lawyers despite partisan differences (proposed but rejected)
