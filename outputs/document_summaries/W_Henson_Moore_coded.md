# George H.W. Bush Transition - W. Henson Moore Interview
**Date**: October 15, 1999
**Interviewee**: W. Henson Moore (Deputy Chief of Staff, February 1992 - January 1993)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Moore served as Deputy Chief of Staff during Bush's reelection campaign year (February 1992 - January 1993), brought in when Skinner replaced Sununu. Former Congressman from Louisiana and Deputy Secretary of Energy. Interview is extraordinarily candid about White House dysfunction, the "Oval Office effect" that causes staff to lose nerve when speaking truth to power, and limitations Moore/Skinner faced without personal trust relationship or hire-and-fire authority. Describes Jim Baker as only person who could tell Bush truth. Key theme: "best of times, worst of times" - proximity to power vs. "snake pit" culture.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Forced into Change - Bush's Reluctance
> "I don't think the President was very happy about changing his Chief and Deputy Chief of Staff. I think he felt forced into doing all this. I don't think he was very happy about it. He didn't look very happy when he talked to me that evening. So I get the impression all of this had to be done to do something to turn the election around." (p.2)

**Codes**: forced-change, presidential-reluctance, external-pressure, george-w-bush-role
**Memo**: Bush didn't want to fire Sununu/Card - was pushed into it (George W. Bush involved). This creates dynamic where new staff (Skinner/Moore) don't have president's full buy-in or trust. Antecedent: external pressure for staff changes. Consequence: weakened authority for new team. Bush's reluctance foreshadows Moore's later observation that they lacked the trust relationship necessary for effectiveness.

### 2. Bush Preferred Affairs of State Over Campaigning
> "President Bush didn't like it. He wanted to be President of the United States. He didn't like running for re-election. He didn't like any time being taken away from the affairs of state. He was very dedicated to being a good President and he was at his best when he was on the telephone talking to foreign heads of state... That was his strong point, and that's what he enjoyed doing, and he liked doing." (p.3)

**Codes**: presidential-preference, governing-vs-campaigning, competence-area, resentment-of-politics
**Memo**: Bush resented having to campaign - "You sort of feel a little resentful for having to do that. If you're a good president and doing a good job, why do you have to go through all this stuff?" This created tension in election year - president focused on what he enjoyed (foreign policy) rather than what was needed (domestic/economic message). Not sycophancy per se, but shows president's preferences can conflict with political necessities.

### 3. Buchanan Primary Challenge Creating Resentment
> "That was particularly true in the early spring of 1992, when we were having to deal with Pat Buchanan in a Republican primary. There was a great deal of resentment in the White House toward Buchanan and toward this whole '…why do we have to do this?' It was taking away valuable time from running the country, and also, valuable time of dealing with the real opponent, Clinton." (p.4)

**Codes**: primary-challenge-resentment, distraction, time-allocation
**Memo**: Staff and Bush resented having to fight Buchanan in primaries instead of focusing on Clinton or governing. "Why do we have to do this?" Shows how political necessities can conflict with sense of presidential dignity/mission. All staff wanted to be involved in campaign but only few interfaced with it.

### 4. Newt Gingrich "Relegated" to Moore
> "Newt Gingrich was relegated to me. Sam Skinner didn't want to talk to him and, if you know Newt Gingrich, Newt Gingrich is a brilliant individual, but also abrasive. He's got an idea a minute. And out of the sixty he has in the course of an hour, probably two are worth listening to, but you've got to listen to all sixty to find the two. So, I was the one that would take Newt's calls." (p.5)

**Codes**: delegating-difficult-people, managing-difficult-relationships, screening-access
**Memo**: Skinner delegated Gingrich to Moore - ranking Republican in House but too abrasive/voluminous for COS to handle. Moore as buffer. Strategic subordination: Moore handled time-consuming relationships so Skinner didn't have to. Not sycophancy but shows hierarchy of access and protection of senior staff time.

### 5. Attending Every Presidential Meeting - Witness Function
> "Every meeting the President had, I would attend. Either Sam or I, or both, but generally, always me. No matter who he was meeting with, one of the two of us was always in the Oval Office with the President, unless he decreed it otherwise, and wanted it to be a personal meeting... The purpose was several-fold. One was to be there to run interference for the President, if necessary. Secondly, it was to see that the President was staffed, that he knew right before the meeting what this was all about... And it was also for continuity, so that there was another person there, who heard what went on in the meeting. If this person [visitor] would go out and say something to the press or whatever—he had been all by himself with the President—you don't want the President to go out and correct what's in the press. You want somebody else to be able to do that. I would say: you never want anybody meeting privately with a president. It's just not the way you best serve him or protect him." (p.5-6)

**Codes**: witness-function, protecting-president, staffing-meetings, continuity, controlling-narrative
**Memo**: Moore or Skinner in every meeting unless president specifically wanted privacy. Three purposes: (1) run interference, (2) brief president, (3) witness to control narrative afterward. "You never want anybody meeting privately with a president." This is protective service, not sycophancy - ensuring president isn't exposed or misrepresented. But also controls what gets said and done.

### 6. Oval Office Effect - "The Emperor Has No Clothes"
> "Absolutely. Well, it's more with the staff than I've found with people [outside]. But you have hit upon something—the emperor has no clothes—that could be applied to a president of the United States. People will gather right in the anteroom, right before you go in to the Oval Office, and they will be very demonstrative: '…the President has to be told that speech stunk… the President has to be told he has to come out and do something on this…we're going to go in there and do it.' Of course, I'm going in with them, having staffed the President ahead of time that, 'You're going to have this meeting; these people want to talk to you about this, either your staff or supporters…,' or whatever. They'll get in that Oval Office and, I mean, the whole thing just evaporates. It just evaporates. Something about going into the Oval Office with the President of the United States, they just suddenly lose all the demonstrativeness. It just evaporates. I've seen it happen over and over again. I've come out shaking my head." (p.7)

**Codes**: oval-office-effect, emperor-has-no-clothes, evaporation-of-resolve, awe-of-office, sycophantic-collapse
**Memo**: CRITICAL PASSAGE. Staff demonstrative in anteroom about needing to confront president, then completely lose nerve in Oval Office. "The whole thing just evaporates." Moore kept diary and recorded this "over and over again." This is sycophancy as psychological phenomenon - physical setting and presidential presence overwhelming rational intentions. Antecedent: aura of office. Manifestation: inability to deliver hard messages despite planning to do so. Consequence: president doesn't get truth.

### 7. Marlin Fitzwater Example - "Never Count on Me"
> "One of them. One of them is at Marlin Fitzwater's expense. I'll never forget this as long as I live. We had a staff meeting in Sam's office... We agreed; we all agreed strongly to go in and tell the President, 'He needs to do such and such.' So we decided this is what's going to have to be done. So Sam said, 'Okay, Henson, you and Marlin go in and tell the President.' So off we go down the hall. Marlin says, 'We've got to do this, got to do this…,' whatever. Marlin is a funny guy; funny funny. We got into a flap somewhere and Marlin once told me, 'Henson, I guess, in a tough fight, don't count on me.' He said it flippantly. Anyway, we go in to see the President and present this. I'm laying it out and laying it on thick, 'You've got to do this.'... So I'm laying it out to the President. He's sitting back in his seat. Bush never cursed, never abused anybody, was the finest gentleman I've ever run across in politics or any place else. He just looked up, 'I don't think I'm going to do that. I don't want to do that.' I kept pushing. I turned to Marlin and said, 'Marlin, give me some support in this, because we just left this meeting where everyone agreed.' Marlin said, 'I agree, Mr. President, I think you're actually right about that.' I just about exploded. I kind of bit my lip. The answer was no. We went back out in the anteroom; I turned on [Marlin] and was just about ready to eat him alive, and he said, 'Henson, I told you: never count on me,' and he walked off laughing. So it was a perfect example of that evaporation." (p.7-8)

**Codes**: sycophantic-collapse, abandonment-in-oval-office, fitzwater-reversal, staff-agreement-evaporation, humor-masking-sycophancy
**Memo**: QUINTESSENTIAL EXAMPLE. Staff agreed Moore and Fitzwater would tell President X. Walking down hall, Fitzwater says "got to do this." Moore lays it out forcefully in Oval Office. Bush says no. Moore turns to Fitzwater for support. Fitzwater: "I agree, Mr. President, I think you're actually right about that." Complete reversal. Fitzwater had warned "in a tough fight, don't count on me" but said it "flippantly" - Moore didn't take seriously. This is classic sycophantic behavior - agreement outside room, compliance inside room. Fitzwater uses humor to defuse Moore's anger. Perfect illustration of "evaporation."

### 8. Jim Baker's Warning - Bush Doesn't Like Being Handled
> "I had gone over and had a private meeting with Jim Baker after I'd been on the job about two weeks, because nobody knew the President better than Jim Baker. I said, 'Jim, how do I do this job?' He had been Chief of Staff to [Ronald] Reagan and he knew all this stuff. I'll never forget. He said, 'Henson, he doesn't like being handled. You can't handle George Bush like you would a candidate, tell him where you want him, what stage, what to say, what to do. He just resents that. He rebels at that. The only time he'll ever do it is when he's looking over an abyss. When he knows: If he doesn't do it, it's a free fall into obscurity.'" (p.8)

**Codes**: resistance-to-handling, presidential-autonomy, crisis-necessity, baker-wisdom, management-limits
**Memo**: Baker's advice: Bush resents being managed like candidate. Will only accept direction "when he's looking over an abyss" - facing disaster. This creates impossible situation for staff in election year - need to manage president's message/appearances, but president resents this unless crisis is obvious. Anti-sycophantic insight: don't flatter or manipulate, only direct when stakes are existential. But also shows limits of staff influence when president resistant.

### 9. Line-Item Veto Rebuff - "Not Going to Cheapen the Office"
> "So I took occasion—I was traveling with him. In fact, we were in my hometown of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We were holding, waiting either before or after a speech he was giving. I brought it up—unfinished business because they didn't do a good job—to my detriment. He turned to me and he said, 'I'm not going to do anything that cheapens the Office of the Presidency. If you can give me some good legal opinions that indicate we've got a chance to win on this thing, then I'll consider it. But if all you're trying to do is get me to do something that⎯"Let's just go see what happens, let's just take a flier in the dark and it will make conservatives happy and help us in the re-election again but ultimately we'll probably lose the case⎯'I'm not going to do that.' He said it in a pretty forceful way. We were kind of careful about what we'd take back to him." (p.9)

**Codes**: protecting-office-dignity, forceful-rejection, careful-after-rebuff, cheapening-presidency, political-calculation-vs-principle
**Memo**: Moore brought up line-item veto test case during downtime. Bush forcefully rejected: won't "cheapen the Office of the Presidency" just to please conservatives or help reelection. "He said it in a pretty forceful way. We were kind of careful about what we'd take back to him." Consequence: staff learned not to bring certain things. This is president resisting political opportunism - anti-sycophantic in refusing to be handled. But also intimidates staff from pushing back - creates careful/cautious dynamic that is sycophantic.

### 10. Only Jim Baker Could Tell Bush Truth
> "Sam Skinner and I were not that close to the President. [In] neither one of us, I don't think, did the President have that close respect for, like a Jim Baker, to where he'd sit and listen to us. We were staff and he listened to us politely but, if his initial instinct was different from mine or Sam's, he'd go with his initial instinct. We did not have the ability to turn him from that. I think that's why, at the very end of the day, Jim Baker was brought back in as Chief of Staff: there really was only one man the President probably would listen to... I never went in there with him with Jim Baker, who was the one person I would say clearly the President had respect for, clearly he had known the President forever and clearly would probably tell the President what he needed to hear. He may have been the only one. I don't know who else would have been in that category. But all the people I ever went with to the President, I never saw it." (p.8-9)

**Codes**: unique-trust-relationship, inability-to-influence, baker-exceptionalism, listening-politely-ignoring, initial-instinct-prevails
**Memo**: CRITICAL. Moore and Skinner lacked personal trust relationship with Bush. "He listened to us politely but, if his initial instinct was different from mine or Sam's, he'd go with his initial instinct." Only Jim Baker had the relationship to tell Bush truth and be heard. "He may have been the only one." This creates sycophancy by default - if only one person can speak truth, everyone else either stays silent or gets ignored. Structural sycophancy from lack of trusted advisers.

### 11. Using Oval Office as Political Weapon
> MK: "Were there times when you could use the Oval Office as a resource in a political situation—"
> WHM: "Absolutely. We did it all the time... That was the ultimate weapon a president had, to have somebody come to the Oval Office for a meeting. That's something few members of Congress ever get... you're darn right; that is something you use politically. So we would use that. The campaign would let us know who they thought in a campaign year was important to get in with the President... The other thing, of course, was for the President to go out to their town and do a fund-raiser for them, or some kind of political event. But the White House—definitely the same aura that causes people to have tribulations or hesitancies about saying what they really think, the opposite side of that coin is: it's a great tool to get somebody in there. They are flattered beyond end, and you always have to have a picture taken." (p.9-10)

**Codes**: oval-office-as-weapon, political-tool, flattery-by-access, aura-exploitation, photo-trophy
**Memo**: Same Oval Office aura that causes sycophantic collapse among staff is deliberately exploited as political tool with outsiders. "They are flattered beyond end." Access = currency. Photo with president = "trophy." Strategic use of sycophancy-inducing environment. Moore acknowledges dual nature: "the same aura that causes people to have tribulations or hesitancies" is "a great tool." Bidirectional sycophancy: environment causes deference which is then weaponized.

### 12. Bush's Noblesse Oblige and Refusal to Exploit Personal Stories
> "He never would talk about his daughter who died of leukemia. He wouldn't talk about it publicly. That was something private... I never will forget one night I was working late, and a groundskeeper knocked on the glass door of my office... He said, 'Is the President here?'... 'We were waiting to play horseshoes with him. He usually comes out and plays horseshoes when he's in town.'... He would play horseshoes with the groundskeepers, not staff, of the White House. Him and three other members—they had a little league going, of people who mowed the grass and cut the hedges. I said: 'Is that a political gold mine?' I said something like that. Everybody thought the President was a rich kid and a silver spoon in his mouth. I said this is the kind of stuff we've got to get to the public. He stopped me and he said, 'No, you don't. These people are my friends and this is something I do with them, and we're not going to use that.'... He thought that was improper, that he was violating something for political gain. He just wouldn't do it." (p.15-16)

**Codes**: protecting-privacy, refusing-exploitation, noblesse-oblige, genuine-relationships, principled-boundaries
**Memo**: Bush had politically valuable personal stories (dead daughter, horseshoes with groundskeepers, Navy combat) but refused to exploit them. "These people are my friends and this is something I do with them, and we're not going to use that." Anti-sycophantic principle: won't pander or manipulate for political gain. "He thought that was improper, that he was violating something for political gain." Moore notes this may have cost election but respects principle. Contrast to Clinton/Reagan who showed "emotional vulnerability" in speeches - Bush refused. Shows how anti-sycophantic integrity can be political liability.

### 13. POW-MIA Event - Judgment Call Gone Wrong
> "We took the President over there. Four or five people stood up in the audience and began to raise hell. The President got into a shouting match with them. He got into the car afterwards and he asked the question, 'How did I get put in this position?' And I had to answer, 'Mr. President, I put you in that position.' You have to take it. The staff did it. Me and all the people under me who brought this up, along with Brent Scowcroft—he just weighed in and said, 'Yes, I think it's something you ought to do.' That was a judgment call... It was a judgment call I made, and I'll never forget it because the President felt we let him down. We got him into something a president shouldn't have been involved in. He should not have been in a shouting match with some goofballs." (p.18)

**Codes**: judgment-failure, taking-responsibility, presidential-disappointment, staff-letdown, shouting-match
**Memo**: Moore approved POW-MIA event. Protesters confronted Bush, Bush got into shouting match. In car: "How did I get put in this position?" Moore took responsibility: "Mr. President, I put you in that position." Shows accountability but also shows consequences of bad judgment - "the President felt we let him down." This is anti-sycophantic in taking blame, but the mistake itself partly stemmed from not having good enough "intelligence" or judgment about event.

### 14. Qualities Needed - No Agenda But President's
> "First of all, the president has to know them and have high regard for them; otherwise they're going to be very limited in how useful they can be to him. Secondly, they really ought to have some political experience. This is no place to have on-the-job-training in politics... Thirdly, you've got to basically have no agenda but that of the president. And there are people in White Houses I've run across that have their own agendas, and that does not serve the president well. So, you want people there whose only agenda is to see to it [that] his agenda is executed upon and, where you can be, [are] successful doing that." (p.18)

**Codes**: servant-leadership-ideal, no-personal-agenda, political-experience, trust-prerequisite
**Memo**: Moore articulates ideal: staff with "no agenda but that of the president." But acknowledges "there are people in White Houses I've run across that have their own agendas, and that does not serve the president well." This is anti-sycophancy ideal - genuine service vs. self-interest. But Moore himself violated this (see later excerpt on bypassing staff to get economic plan to president). Gap between stated ideal and actual practice.

### 15. Moore Warned About Personal Agenda
> "One of the first meetings I set up with the President was with independent oil operators: for him to meet with them in the Roosevelt Room. And I had to watch that. People were saying, the Chief of Staff said to me, 'Henson, watch yourself that you're not getting into your old agenda. Be careful about that.' I don't think those incidents happened again, and I'd have done it again in this case, because these were people the President was close to. He'd been in that industry... But I was accused of—I'm sure people raised their eyebrows over that. So you do have to watch that. It is difficult." (p.19)

**Codes**: personal-agenda-warning, energy-background, self-monitoring, difficult-to-separate
**Memo**: Moore came from Deputy Secretary of Energy, worked on national energy strategy. Set up meeting with oil operators (his old world). Skinner warned: "watch yourself that you're not getting into your old agenda." Moore acknowledges difficulty of separating personal interests from presidential service. Even with good intentions, expertise can become agenda.

### 16. Information Bypassing Chief of Staff - Scheduler Example
> "Supposedly nothing goes to the president but by the chief of staff or the deputy chief of staff. I'm pretty sure that, on our watch, information did get to the President around us from staffers who felt like they knew the President better than we did. I'm confident some things did... You get a decision from the President on something, that's different from the one that you were staffing him to come up with. I found it on scheduling. It would be agreed that the President was going to a certain place. And that I think the scheduler disagreed with me, and felt like she wasn't going to waste her breath with me. She'd just bring it up to the President in one of the private conversations, because she knew him better than I did, she felt. I'd send the schedule in, and it would come back with that X'ed off. There was no discussion. So I knew exactly what happened. I had evidence of that happening." (p.19-20)

**Codes**: end-runs, scheduler-bypassing, direct-presidential-access, undermining-chain-of-command, personal-relationship-advantage
**Memo**: Kathy Super (scheduler) would bypass Moore, go directly to Bush in private conversations when she disagreed with Moore's decisions. Schedule would come back changed, no discussion. "She knew him better than I did, she felt." Classic end-run around formal authority structure. Antecedent: long-standing personal relationship (Super had been with Bush long time). Consequence: Moore's authority undermined. This is staff sycophancy toward president that bypasses proper channels.

### 17. Face Time Most Important - "I Know What's Really Right"
> "Face time or attention with the president is, without a doubt, the most important thing on the mind of any staffer in the White House. A lot of them come there with agendas. They're extremely bright. 'If they weren't that bright why are they inside the picket fence and everybody else is outside?' I've found that more than any other place in politics I've been, this feeling that 'I don't care what you say, I hear what you're saying; I know what's really right and I'm going to get that to the President.' They'll never tell you that, but that's what's going on in their mind. I even did it. I did it one time." (p.20)

**Codes**: face-time-obsession, staff-hubris, picket-fence-arrogance, knowing-better, end-run-mentality
**Memo**: CRITICAL. "Face time or attention with the president is, without a doubt, the most important thing on the mind of any staffer in the White House." Staff think they're smarter ("If they weren't that bright why are they inside the picket fence"), believe they know what's right, will go around formal processes. "I even did it. I did it one time." Shows how pervasive this is - even Moore, who articulates the problem, admits to doing it himself.

### 18. Moore's Own End-Run - Economic Plan
> "I kept trying to convince the President to deliver a major speech on his economic program. I sat down and worked it up myself... I couldn't get the White House staff to agree with it. The economic advisers didn't like it, and Brady and Darman and the Chief of the Council of Economic Advisers, Boskin, who had all been telling the President—and Sununu when he was there—that the economy was going to get well before the election... So, lo and behold, about the mid-part of August or sometime before the [Republican] convention, I'm sitting there saying I've tried to do it the way you're supposed to do and I'm not getting anywhere: 'The hell with it.' So I just wrote the damned outline of the program, took it in and put it on [the President's] desk and bypassed even Skinner. I did it myself. So I can understand how—I get the thing back from the President with a note, 'Henson, this looks good. Let's do something with this.' So I took that and showed it to Skinner and everybody and they began to think, 'You sonofabitch, you went behind our back' and blah, blah, blah. Well, needless to say, nothing got done with it because the convention was coming up, and whatever. But I had my day, because right after Labor Day the President spoke to... the Detroit Economic Club and gave a speech⎯and it was what I had written!" (p.20-21)

**Codes**: bypassing-process, direct-to-president, staff-anger, vindication, self-justification, violating-own-principles
**Memo**: Moore tried repeatedly through channels to get economic plan. Staff (Brady, Darman, Boskin) opposed. Moore finally said "The hell with it" and put plan directly on Bush's desk, bypassing Skinner. Bush wrote back "this looks good." Staff furious: "You sonofabitch, you went behind our back." Months later under Baker, Bush gave that speech. Moore violated his own stated principles about no agendas, going through proper channels. But felt justified: tried proper way, got nowhere, acted out of conviction. Shows how even well-intentioned people violate norms when frustrated.

### 19. Chief of Staff as Traffic Cop - Only Baker Could Control
> "So even I did it. It does go on in a White House. I think every chief of staff has to be the traffic cop, has to control it as best he can, and see to it that everything comes through him so he can properly staff the President. I think, in practical terms, the only way that's going to happen is if you have somebody who is so close to the President, like Jim Baker, that he will have your head, and the president won't be able to protect you, to stop something like that from happening." (p.21)

**Codes**: traffic-cop-function, baker-authority, presidential-protection, control-limits
**Memo**: Even recognizing the problem and experiencing it himself, Moore concludes only solution is someone like Jim Baker "who is so close to the President" that "he will have your head, and the president won't be able to protect you." Without that relationship, staff will go around you because president will protect them. This is structural problem: without fear of consequences (presidential backing of COS), staff will violate chain of command.

### 20. Skinner Open vs. Baker Closed Leadership
> "Skinner was open. He was collusive; collaborative is a better word. He would have the staff in his office for meetings. He would preside over the full staff meetings in the Roosevelt room. And he was really open about what was going on with the staff and talking about it... So, when things really deteriorated further by June, July and August when the President kept sinking in the polls and it was obvious that something again had to be done to save the presidency or to get it re-elected, everybody knew there was only one person who could do that... When Baker came in, he didn't want to. He absolutely didn't want to... You never saw Baker as Chief of Staff. The staff never saw him. Never did he attend a staff meeting; never did he confer with anybody. He brought in with him two or three people that had been long political associates of his, and those four ran the whole thing, and everybody else took orders. Nobody else was asked, 'What do you think?' Nobody was asked for their opinions. It was, 'Here's the order of the day; now go do it!' I'm not being critical. This is an observation. That's the difference in the two styles." (p.12-13)

**Codes**: collaborative-vs-command, open-vs-closed, baker-vs-skinner, crisis-management, no-consultation
**Memo**: Skinner = collaborative, open, staff meetings. Baker = command, closed, no consultation. "The staff never saw him." Just orders from inner circle. Moore not critical: "I think Baker felt, 'Look, we're down to two months to go before the election; I haven't got time.'" But this is pure hierarchical model where rest of staff just execute, no input. Different from sycophancy - not yes-men but order-takers. Baker's authority so absolute he didn't need sycophants, just executors.

### 21. Fitzwater's "Ceremonial" Reporting Relationship
> "Fitzwater was such a pro. Fitzwater had such a rapport with the President; the President loved him. Fitzwater could get whatever he wanted with the President. Him reporting to me was largely ceremonial. In fact, he would deal with the President and, generally, Fitzwater would talk to Sam and I together about any kind of major thing going on. Fitzwater wouldn't go do that behind our back, or around us, with the President, but the President wouldn't call me about a press matter; he would call Fitzwater." (p.14)

**Codes**: ceremonial-reporting, direct-presidential-relationship, bypassing-formal-structure, presidential-preference
**Memo**: Fitzwater officially reported to Moore but "largely ceremonial." Bush loved Fitzwater, would call him directly about press matters. Fitzwater wouldn't go around Moore deliberately, but relationship with president meant formal reporting structure was irrelevant. This is presidential preference creating informal power structure that supersedes formal organization. Not sycophancy, but shows limits of organizational charts when personal relationships dominate.

### 22. Speechwriting Failures and Inability to Craft Message
> "I envy presidents who have great speechwriters, and can give good speeches, because 'it ain't easy.' Reagan was good at it, and Clinton is very good at it... And we, for all the reasons we've talked about why the President lost, we just never could find the right kind of message that resonated. We never could find the right kind of speechwriter... Bush was a great speaker for as little time as he spent preparing a speech. We would get the speech to him after it had gone through all the speechwriting, and all of us going over the speechwriting, and all of it, to make sure it had the right message. We'd give it to him, and he would work on it maybe a half-hour, maybe an hour, to make edits and changes in it... he didn't spend a great deal of time working on a speech, in terms of delivery or content... We just never could deliver a speech—as a matter of fact, I even met one day with the woman who wrote his speech at the convention. What's her name? Famous woman speechwriter."
> MK: "Peggy Noonan."
> WHM: "The one and only time I met Peggy Noonan was in my office. We were trying to bring her back in to help do some speeches for the President; [she] had a substantial ego and wasn't interested in being involved. Needless to say, nothing ever happened to that." (p.14-15)

**Codes**: speechwriting-struggles, presidential-preparation, message-failure, noonan-ego, inability-to-deliver
**Memo**: Never found right message or speechwriter despite trying. Bush spent minimal time on speeches. Tried to bring back Peggy Noonan (wrote convention speech); she "had a substantial ego and wasn't interested." Contrast to Reagan (spent hours practicing) and Clinton (very good speaker). Shows how even wanting to improve, couldn't get the help needed. Not sycophancy issue directly, but shows limits of staff to compensate for president's weaknesses when right talent won't engage.

### 23. Bush Skipping Emotional Section of Iowa Speech
> MK: "Bush never wanted to put himself in that position. A radio reporter was telling me about the speech he was giving to the families of the people who had died in the U.S.S. Iowa. He said he had gone through the advance text of the speech and he had marked out the one section that was an emotional section. So he said he had his recorder ready to hit it at that point because that's the cut that he wanted. He said it got to that point and Bush skipped right over it."
> WHM: "And that's maybe one reason we weren't very good, because the speechwriters knew or wouldn't write, those kinds of things. Bush had a very high sense of principle of what a President was to do and not to do. I respect the man greatly for it. He would not do anything to cheapen the office or to use the office or to play politics. He just wouldn't do it." (p.15-16)

**Codes**: refusing-emotional-manipulation, skipping-emotional-content, principle-over-politics, cheapening-office
**Memo**: Bush deliberately skipped emotional section of U.S.S. Iowa families speech - wouldn't exploit grief for political effect. "He would not do anything to cheapen the office or to use the office or to play politics." Speechwriters either knew not to write emotional content or he'd skip it. This principled stance hurt politically (Clinton and Reagan used emotional vulnerability effectively) but Bush saw it as protecting office dignity. Anti-sycophantic leadership: refusing to pander even when politically necessary.

### 24. White House as Snake Pit - Source vs. Target
> "The hours are very long. The pressure is very great to succeed for the president, to have him be successful. The internecine warfare and backstabbing is more acute there than I ever saw in the department, or ever saw in the Congress. If something goes wrong, you don't want to be blamed for it; you want to put the blame on somebody else. You want to have an exit strategy that you leave as a hero not as a dog. All those things are swirling around a White House, that I didn't see in Congress, and didn't see in the departments. Skinner and I didn't, and there were others in the White House who didn't, operate that way, but there were definitely some who did. One way you do that is you become a source for the press. Bush made it plain to me when I got there, even though I'd spent a lot of time talking with the press in my political career, that he only wanted two people talking to the press: Marlin and Sam. I said, 'That's fine, Mr. President. I'll do it.' And I never did. I refused to talk to the press. I became abused, because you become either a source or a target—you have a choice—with White House reporters. If you're a source, nothing bad is ever said about you." (p.23)

**Codes**: internecine-warfare, backstabbing, blame-avoidance, exit-strategy, source-vs-target, press-manipulation
**Memo**: Most acute "internecine warfare and backstabbing" Moore ever saw. "If something goes wrong, you don't want to be blamed for it; you want to put the blame on somebody else." People position for heroic exits. "One way you do that is you become a source for the press." Bush said only Fitzwater and Skinner should talk to press. Moore complied, became "abused" as result. "You become either a source or a target... If you're a source, nothing bad is ever said about you." This is sycophancy toward press rather than president - staff trading information for protection. Creates culture of leaking and blame-shifting.

### 25. "Best of Times, Worst of Times"
> "Every time somebody asked me about the White House, the Tale of Two Cities opening line goes through my mind. And it is so descriptive: 'It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.' It was the best of times to be so close to a president, traveling with him every day, overseas, and being with him, and seeing how that works. It was the worst of times, because it was absolutely a snake pit in which to work. Pressure is not descriptive enough. I never felt that way about Congress; never felt that way about the department. Part of it was because I became a target for those who wanted to shield themselves from blame for a White House that was not doing well⎯and it didn't do well. The only measurement was, re-electing Bush. So we all share in that. But I'll take my share of the blame in that. There are people who didn't want any blame in that, that wanted to have themselves viewed as wonderful people who fought the heroic fight, and if people had listened to them things would have been different." (p.24)

**Codes**: best-worst-times, snake-pit, target-status, blame-avoidance, heroic-self-portrayal, election-failure
**Memo**: Dickens quote captures paradox: proximity to power vs. toxic culture. "It was absolutely a snake pit in which to work. Pressure is not descriptive enough." Moore became "target for those who wanted to shield themselves from blame." People wanted to be seen as "wonderful people who fought the heroic fight" - implying others (Moore/Skinner) were the problem. This is post-failure sycophancy: positioning oneself as the truth-teller who was ignored, while blaming others. Classic blame-shifting dynamics.

### 26. Two Fatal Limitations - No Trust, No Authority
> "Sam Skinner and I were not that close to the President. [In] neither one of us, I don't think, did the President have that close respect for, like a Jim Baker, to where he'd sit and listen to us. We were staff and he listened to us politely but, if his initial instinct was different from mine or Sam's, he'd go with his initial instinct. We did not have the ability to turn him from that... Secondly, we did not have hire-and-fire authority. The President had his staff; he had been goaded, pushed, convinced into getting rid of Sununu and Card, people both of whom he liked, and he wasn't going to hear of anybody else being replaced on that staff. So, once that word gets out to the people who are supposed to be reporting to you, and taking orders from you, that you can't touch them, you have limited authority to really make things happen... Those are the two key elements to us being able to have done a better job. Had those things not been present, could we have made a difference? Could we have won the election? I don't know... I would never put anybody in that position in a future White House. It ought to be understood, going in, that those two limitations we had aren't there, or it's not going to work." (p.24-25)

**Codes**: lack-of-trust, no-hire-fire-authority, listening-politely-ignoring, limited-authority, structural-weakness, forced-staff-changes
**Memo**: CRITICAL SUMMARY. Two fatal flaws: (1) No personal trust - Bush "listened to us politely but... he'd go with his initial instinct. We did not have the ability to turn him from that." (2) No hire-and-fire authority - Bush forced to fire Sununu/Card, wouldn't allow more changes. "Once that word gets out to the people who are supposed to be reporting to you... that you can't touch them, you have limited authority." These structural limitations made effective leadership impossible. Staff knew they couldn't be fired, could bypass Moore/Skinner. Without trust relationship, couldn't influence president. This creates worst-case scenario: sycophancy by default because staff know COS is weak.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Oval Office Effect**: Staff lose all nerve when entering Oval Office - "the whole thing just evaporates" despite being demonstrative in anteroom
2. **Only Jim Baker Could Speak Truth**: Bush listened politely to Moore/Skinner but went with own instincts; only Baker had trust relationship to influence
3. **Marlin Fitzwater's Collapse**: Perfect example - agreed outside room, reversed inside room, laughed it off afterward
4. **Bush's Anti-Sycophantic Principles**: Refused to exploit dead daughter, horseshoes with groundskeepers, emotional content in speeches - "wouldn't cheapen the office"
5. **Face Time Obsession**: Most important thing to staff; leads to end-runs and agendas
6. **Information Bypassing**: Scheduler, Fitzwater, others went around Moore directly to president
7. **Snake Pit Culture**: More internecine warfare and backstabbing than Congress or departments
8. **Source vs. Target with Press**: Become source for protection or become target - sycophancy toward press
9. **Everyone's End-Runs**: Even Moore, who articulated the problem, bypassed formal process with economic plan
10. **Structural Powerlessness**: Without trust relationship and hire-and-fire authority, formal position is hollow

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Aura of Oval Office creating psychological intimidation
- Lack of personal trust relationship (Moore/Skinner vs. Baker)
- Forced staff changes (Sununu/Card firing) creating resentment and limiting authority
- Election year pressure creating desperation and blame-avoidance
- Long-standing personal relationships (Super, Fitzwater) creating informal power structures
- Face time scarcity creating competition for access
- Press corps creating source/target dynamic

**Manifestations**:
- Oval Office evaporation - losing nerve in presidential presence
- Fitzwater reversal - agreement outside, compliance inside
- Listening politely then ignoring - Bush's pattern with Moore/Skinner
- End-runs around chain of command - scheduler, Moore's own economic plan
- Blame-shifting and backstabbing - snake pit culture
- Becoming press source for protection rather than serving president
- Ceremonial reporting relationships that bypass formal structure

**Protective Factors**:
- Bush's principled refusal to exploit personal stories or cheapen office
- Jim Baker's warning about not trying to "handle" Bush
- Moore's willingness to take responsibility ("Mr. President, I put you in that position")
- Skinner's collaborative/open style vs. Baker's command style
- Moore's self-awareness about face time obsession and end-run problems
- Bush's resistance to being managed except "when looking over an abyss"

**Consequences**:
- President doesn't get truth - Oval Office effect prevents honest feedback
- Failed election - inability to craft effective message or strategy
- Staff dysfunction - information bypassing, backstabbing, blame-avoidance
- Hollow formal authority - without trust and hire-and-fire power, Moore/Skinner couldn't lead effectively
- Snake pit culture - 12-hour days in toxic environment causing burnout
- No one could deliver hard messages except Baker, who came too late

## Critical Incidents

1. **Marlin Fitzwater Reversal** (p.7-8): Quintessential sycophancy moment - complete evaporation of resolve
2. **Line-Item Veto Rebuff** (p.9): Bush forcefully establishing boundaries, staff learning to be "careful"
3. **POW-MIA Shouting Match** (p.18): Judgment failure, presidential disappointment
4. **Moore's Economic Plan End-Run** (p.20-21): Even principled person violates own rules when frustrated
5. **Scheduler Bypassing** (p.19-20): Schedule comes back changed with no discussion - direct evidence of end-runs

## Notable Contrasts

**Skinner vs. Baker**: Collaborative/open vs. command/closed - both approaches have merits in different contexts

**Bush vs. Clinton/Reagan**: Refused emotional vulnerability vs. used it effectively - principle vs. political effectiveness

**Moore/Skinner vs. Baker**: Polite listening/ignoring vs. trust relationship - formal position vs. personal connection

**Ceremonial vs. Real Authority**: Fitzwater "reporting" to Moore vs. actually working directly with president

**Stated vs. Actual Behavior**: Moore articulates ideal of no agendas, then bypasses process himself when frustrated
