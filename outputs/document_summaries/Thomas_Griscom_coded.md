# Ronald Reagan Transition - Thomas Griscom Interview
**Date**: July 19, 1999
**Interviewee**: Thomas Griscom (Assistant to the President for Communications)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Griscom discusses mid-administration transition when Senator Howard Baker became Chief of Staff during Reagan's second term. Key themes include organizational models (hands-on vs. delegated), staff job insecurity during transitions, serving vs. owning positions, campaign vs. governing personnel, power intoxication, and the importance of institutional memory. Notable for insights on avoiding sycophancy through seeking external advice and knowing when to leave.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Job Insecurity and Self-Interest in Transitions
> "One of the most telling concerns on the minds of the people who are currently in a job is, 'Will I have a job tomorrow?' I think there's a recognition that a chief of staff is—and I'll use business terms; I think it's appropriate—like the COO [chief operating officer] of a corporation." (p.1)

**Codes**: job-insecurity, transition-anxiety, self-interest
**Memo**: Mid-transition creates staff uncertainty about positions. This self-interest can drive sycophantic behavior - staff trying to prove loyalty/value to new leadership. Antecedent: leadership change. Consequence: people "taking their eye off the ball" from actual work.

### 2. Serving the President vs. Self-Promotion
> "I never bought into the notion that there is a turnkey that you can pick up and do. I think it is so much dependent on the individual who's occupying the Oval Office. The reason certain staff people are there is the President, the one who got elected. We're not elected and I think there is a tendency, or there has been a tendency from time to time, for people to forget the fact that, if it weren't for the person sitting in the Oval Office, none of us would be there. We would not exist. That's the whole point: you are there serving at the pleasure of the President. I think there's a tendency to forget that from time to time." (p.7)

**Codes**: service-ideal, self-importance, role-clarity, anti-sycophancy-principle
**Memo**: Griscom articulates anti-sycophantic principle - staff exist to serve president, not themselves. But notes tendency to forget this. Paradox: genuine service (anti-sycophancy) requires remembering subordinate role, but people lose sight of this. Consequence: staff can become self-aggrandizing rather than service-oriented.

### 3. Adapting Structure to Leader's Style
> "You need to understand the elected official, the President, and that person may not have the best communications skills. How do you then adapt a communications structure that supports and brings out the best attributes? [...] It was an ideal situation when we went in from the standpoint that the President understood how to communicate. He could take a piece of paper and make it come to life. This President (Clinton) is very similar. But I would be wary of anybody who said: 'This is the snapshot, here it is.'" (p.7)

**Codes**: adaptive-leadership, complementary-staffing, individual-tailoring
**Memo**: Anti-sycophantic approach - don't force president into a model, adapt model to president. Contrast to sycophantic mirroring (earlier Hartmann code). Here it's about complementing weaknesses, not just reflecting leader. Strategic service vs. blind compliance.

### 4. Bush Staff Failure - Mirroring vs. Complementing
> "I have a lot of respect for President [George H. W.] Bush. In some cases I think he was forced into a model that was not supportive of the way he communicated. Therefore, there were times that awkwardness came out. [...] Well, right there was a staff failure, because they did not understand the person they served, and how best to put him in an environment. His staff threw him into this 'great photo op.' They get there and what should have been a good event turned into a negative event." (p.8)

**Codes**: staff-failure, understanding-principal, complementary-vs-mirror-staffing
**Memo**: Bush had staff that reflected his interests rather than complemented his weaknesses. He wasn't effective communicator and had Sununu who also wasn't effective communicator. "That function simply was never performed." Antecedent: homophily without strategic complementarity. Consequence: governance failures (scanner gaffe).

### 5. Hands-On vs. Delegated Management Models
> "Well, a hands-on approach is where there's what I would call one major choke point. That choke point is: everything flows through the chief of staff's office. Nothing gets through and into the president without a chief of staff having reviewed it, signed off on it. You're a much stronger traffic cop to limit access to the president. [...] The more delegated—[...] Senator Baker's style, interestingly, was very much like President Reagan's, which was also one of delegation, but it meant what was termed as, Senator Baker's 'no surprise rule,' meaning, 'I don't want to wake up and read something in the Washington Post that I wasn't at least aware of earlier.'" (p.2-3)

**Codes**: management-models, hierarchical-control, delegated-authority, information-flow
**Memo**: Two organizational approaches with different sycophancy implications. Hands-on (Don Regan/Jim Baker model) = everything through chief = potential for sycophantic gatekeeping. Delegated (Howard Baker model) = responsibility with accountability = less hierarchical deference but requires trust. Both can enable or resist sycophancy depending on execution.

### 6. Don Regan's Closed System
> "MK: His [Don Regan's] was pretty much a closed system. In part, what precedes you is going to shape what you do, too. Everybody referred to [Regan's] aides as the mice, and they developed hostility to that kind of system: when you come in you have to have a strong change.
> TG: Right. You have the advantage to look at what did not work." (p.3)

**Codes**: closed-system, staff-resentment, organizational-model, hierarchical-sycophancy
**Memo**: Regan's aides called "the mice" - clear sycophantic image. Closed hub-and-spoke system bred hostility from rest of staff. Antecedent: concentrated control. Consequence: system failure, need for dramatic change when Baker arrived. Shows extreme hierarchical model creates sycophantic inner circle resented by others.

### 7. Campaign People's Resentment of Washington Insiders
> "It is. There's a lot of resentment, because you weren't there from the beginning, you weren't there in the trenches. It's like a spoils system. 'I was there; I picked President Clinton as my candidate; you went with other candidates. So I should have control to some extent.' [...] It is hard to allow some gray-hair elder statesman to take your place." (p.16)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-washington, resentment, spoils-system, loyalty-claims
**Memo**: Campaign staff feel entitled based on early loyalty - sycophancy as currency for rewards. "I was there sweating, running around [...] to get a person elected. Now, it's my time to get the rewards!" Antecedent: campaign loyalty. Consequence: resistance to policy expertise, difficulty transitioning to governance. Sycophancy built on early loyalty conflicts with effective governing.

### 8. Generational Arrogance
> "There's a large part of that. I can say this now, as I turn fifty: there is a generational perspective in a campaign: 'I may look young; I may be young in age. But I'm pretty smart; I've been around the track. Why do I need somebody who's forty, fifty years old coming in here? They don't understand my generation. Here's what we were doing. We were reaching out and setting the stage for the next millennium; these are old, dated people who have been here before and they're part of the problem. You went out and tilted with the windmill and you won. Why do you need those people now?'" (p.17)

**Codes**: generational-hubris, arrogance, inexperience, rejecting-wisdom
**Memo**: Young campaign staff's resistance to experienced advisers. Anti-learning posture masquerading as confidence. Antecedent: electoral victory creating sense of invincibility. Consequence: reinventing wheel, rejecting institutional memory. Inverse sycophancy problem - won't defer to expertise because of overconfidence in campaign success.

### 9. Power Intoxication
> "What I found in the White House, the disappointing part, was there were too many people who came in who did not understand political responsibility. All of a sudden they're thrown into a world where a White House operator picks up the phone and calls virtually any place saying, 'This is the White House. I've got so-and-so,' and people stop what they're doing and they will take the call. [...] That to me is one of the big downsides, because an administration is so big you can't monitor all that. You get that call from the White House, you know it must be important, and you'll take it. And too many people get in there—the White House-it's their first real taste of authority or power—and it goes to their head. Then it gets misused. That's how mistakes happen." (p.19)

**Codes**: power-intoxication, ego, responsibility-failure, authority-misuse
**Memo**: White House position creates sycophantic deference FROM others (people take your calls). Staff misuse this - "it goes to their head." Antecedent: first taste of real power/authority. Consequence: abuse, mistakes. Sycophancy as bidirectional - staff become accustomed to others' deference and lose grounding.

### 10. Ownership vs. Service Mentality
> "I had some of my former colleagues call me—we'd moved back to Tennessee—and they asked the question, 'How is it?' I said, 'Great.' They would tell me how much they just admired that we could walk away from this and go back to Tennessee. I said, 'Why are you admiring me? You can do the same thing.' 'No. I don't think I could ever go back.' [...] Then as the months go on, President [George H. W.] Bush gets elected. They're all just sitting there thinking, 'There's no way the Bush Administration can replace us.' It's like they owned the job. [...] 'I did not create my job. I did not create a transition that's new and unique. What I did was learn from others. If I had a chance to make some impact, fine. But I don't own the job.'" (p.20)

**Codes**: job-ownership, entitlement, intoxication, service-vs-ego, exit-readiness
**Memo**: Colleagues couldn't imagine leaving - "It's like they owned the job." Classic sycophancy consequence - position becomes identity, can't separate self from role. Griscom's anti-sycophantic stance: "I don't own the job," awareness of those who came before and after. Antecedent: being "so intoxicated" by getting there. Consequence: inability to move on, clinging to position. Protective factor: humility about role's temporary nature.

### 11. Learning from Diverse Advisers
> "One of the things I did was have an informal group that I would talk to every week, just to make sure you don't lose perspective. [...] Some of them had been press secretaries. Some of them were reporters. Some of them were policy people. They were both Republicans and Democrats. [...] It was really designed to understand what-we're-doing-right; what-we're-doing-wrong. [...] The first piece of advice most of them gave—and they were right—is, 'You will come in there with your breath taken away, when you look at the magnitude of what you have to deal with. And you come in from the outside, and you're not tainted by the White House, but within a short period of time you'll get consumed.'" (p.12)

**Codes**: external-advice, cross-party-consultation, avoiding-isolation, perspective-maintenance
**Memo**: Griscom's deliberate anti-sycophancy strategy - weekly informal advisers from diverse backgrounds, both parties. Kept private, focused on "what-we're-doing-right; what-we're-doing-wrong." Prevented consumption by daily management. Protective factor: intentional reality-checking from outsiders. Contrast to isolation that breeds sycophancy.

### 12. Knowing When to Leave
> "All I can do is speak for myself. I knew it was time to leave. With any job I've had I go in with a set of goals I want to achieve; they're personal goals. I don't print them or openly discuss them. Senator Baker and I did talk about them. I know what I want to achieve and if I get them done then, at that point I stop and ask myself: 'Is there something else now, that is a reason to stay, or is it time to move on?' To date, I have never had a second thought, after achieving what I wanted to do going in, that I said I should stay longer." (p.20)

**Codes**: goal-setting, exit-planning, self-awareness, mission-orientation
**Memo**: Anti-sycophancy through mission-focus rather than position-focus. Griscom set specific goals (1. transition, 2. get through Iran-Contra without impeachment, 3. restore poll numbers/legacy). Achieved them, left. Contrast to colleagues who couldn't leave. Protective factor: entering with defined objectives rather than seeking position for its own sake.

### 13. Lost Institutional Memory Under Don Regan
> "But I do think you need people who were there, almost from the beginning, because they understand the fundamentals of what got the president to a certain point. I think part of what happened in the Reagan administration, with the big changeover, is that—and a lot of people that were in there with Don Regan are good friends of mine—you lost that institutional memory, what were the core [policies]. I've spoken before about, 'Let Reagan be Reagan.' Well, that happened. And the way that he had worked as a governor of California and in the first presidential term, he was being himself. But they took that phrase literally, to let him manage the place, and that was a lack of understanding. That's not his best strength." (p.21)

**Codes**: institutional-memory-loss, turnover-consequences, misunderstanding-leader, delegation-failure
**Memo**: Regan's purge lost people who understood "what were the core [policies]." New staff misunderstood "Let Reagan be Reagan" - let him delegate, not manage details. "That's not his best strength. We saw the results: it sort of got loose." Consequence of sycophancy: yes-men who don't understand leader's actual strengths/weaknesses. Antecedent: wholesale staff replacement. Result: Iran-Contra.

### 14. Reagan's Delegation vs. Clinton's Hands-On Style
> "If all of a sudden you say, 'We're going to have the President manage the details. Everything flows to the top.' In this White House, I think the answer is yes. This President loves to be in the middle of everything. President Reagan did not." (p.21)

**Codes**: presidential-style, delegation, management-preference, leader-differences
**Memo**: Different presidents require different staff structures. Reagan = delegator, Clinton = hands-on. Staff must adapt to president's actual working style, not impose model. Sycophancy risk: forcing president to manage in way contrary to strengths (Reagan under Regan) or assuming all presidents are same.

### 15. Campaign vs. Governing Tension
> "I think where this administration started off rocky was the health care plan which was more of a policy wonk issue and ignoring the fact that it's also a political issue. You've got to sell it. You want to understand how you took an issue and sold it from a campaign standpoint. So I think you have to blend the two together. You want the firm footing for historical purposes of the policy people and those who claim to protect the presidency which is important. But then you also want to bring in the political viewpoint—this element that drives you to go out and sell it." (p.13)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-governing, policy-vs-politics, blending-skills
**Memo**: Need both campaign people (loyalty, know how leader communicates) and policy people (substance, governing experience). Clinton health care failed by being "policy wonk issue" without political selling. Neither pure sycophancy (campaign loyalists only) nor pure technocracy (policy experts only) works. Effective governance requires blend.

### 16. Presidents as Politicians Who Compromise
> "Really, by their nature, presidents are politicians, and politicians want to please people.
> TG: And they compromise all the time.
> MK: Yes.
> TG: You're in here. I'll tell you what you want to hear, because then I can go over here and tell somebody something else; the likelihood that you ever connect the dots is pretty slim." (p.17)

**Codes**: presidential-nature, compromise, pleasing-people, managing-multiple-audiences
**Memo**: Presidents naturally inclined to please, tell people what they want to hear. This isn't sycophancy but creates environment where sycophancy can flourish - if president tells everyone what they want, staff may do same. Also explains why presidents struggle with personnel decisions - "A lot of them are not good personnel people; they don't like to have to make those choices."

### 17. Brandenburg Gate Speech - Standing Up to State Department
> "I'll give you an example that's been written about before. That is in the speech that President Reagan made at the Brandenburg Gate in Germany. [...] We put in a line where President Reagan called on Mr. Gorbachev to '…come and tear down this wall….' There was high-level concern in the State Department about that line being delivered, because it would be viewed as an affront to Mr. Gorbachev. There were a lot of discussions, ultimately resolved with a meeting involving Sen. Baker and Secretary [George] Shultz. I was brought into that discussion, because all the communications functions flowed through me. [...] And the discussion focused on why it was important, why this President was the right president to deliver that line. It was consistent with the direction that had been charted and, as you know, the line was left in and now has been repeated over and over." (p.6)

**Codes**: principled-stance, resisting-bureaucratic-pressure, policy-debate, speaking-truth-to-power
**Memo**: Communications shop developed "tear down this wall" line. State Department objected - too confrontational. Baker/Griscom defended it to Shultz, kept it in. Anti-sycophantic behavior - standing up for what's right for president even when senior cabinet objects. Outcome vindicated position. Shows healthy debate vs. automatic deference.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Service vs. Ownership**: Core tension between genuinely serving president vs. treating position as personal possession/entitlement
2. **Power Intoxication**: First taste of White House authority goes to people's heads, gets misused
3. **Campaign Loyalty as Currency**: Early supporters feel entitled to rewards, resent experienced Washington people
4. **Organizational Models**: Hands-on (Regan - "the mice") vs. delegated (Baker) with different sycophancy dynamics
5. **Complementing vs. Mirroring**: Need staff who complement president's weaknesses, not just reflect interests
6. **Institutional Memory**: Wholesale staff changes lose understanding of "core policies"
7. **External Reality Checks**: Griscom's diverse informal advisers prevented isolation
8. **Goal-Oriented Service**: Having specific missions enables clean exits; position-seeking leads to clinging

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- First taste of power/authority
- Electoral victory creating sense of entitlement
- Wholesale leadership changes causing job insecurity
- Campaign loyalty culture
- Youth/generational arrogance
- Presidents' natural tendency to please people

**Manifestations**:
- Staff acting like they "own" jobs
- Misusing White House operator access
- Closed systems (Regan's "mice")
- Forgetting they serve at president's pleasure
- Resentment toward experienced outsiders
- Inability to imagine leaving

**Consequences**:
- Lost institutional memory (Iran-Contra)
- Poor governance (health care rollout, Bush photo ops)
- Staff failures from not understanding president
- Mistakes from power misuse
- Inability to transition out

**Protective Factors**:
- Seeking diverse external advice (both parties)
- Goal-setting and mission focus
- Humility about role's temporary nature
- Understanding you don't own the job
- Learning from predecessors
- Knowing when to leave
- Adapting structure to president rather than forcing president into model
