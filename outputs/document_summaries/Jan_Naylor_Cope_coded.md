# George H. W. Bush Transition - Jan Naylor Cope Interview
**Date**: June 8, 2000
**Interviewee**: Jan Naylor Cope (Deputy Director, Presidential Personnel Office)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Cope worked in Presidential Personnel for all four years of Bush administration (1989-1993), starting with boards and commissions, then becoming deputy director. Provides detailed insights into personnel operations, the transition process, and White House work life. Key themes include the role of personal Texas networks in appointments, campaign workers seeking jobs, managing multiple pressure sources, and the collaborative rather than dictatorial approach Bush preferred for personnel decisions.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Bush's Tone-Setting: Expectations of Sacrifice
> "I remember very distinctly our first day being sworn in, Mr. [George] Bush was very clear on what his parameters were, what his guidelines were. He had a lot of the family members for the senior staff there for the swearing in and he said, 'I want to tell you from the outset this is going to be really tough on you, the families. It's long hours. The pay is not terrific. But what we're doing is really important and thank you for supporting these people, because it's not going to be easy, always pleasant, and all those good things. You're not going to see them very much, at least from the outset, from the beginning.'" (p.1)

**Codes**: tone-setting, service-expectations, presidential-leadership, sacrifice-framing
**Memo**: Bush frames White House service as sacrifice for important cause. Sets expectations upfront about difficulty. Anti-sycophantic in honesty about costs, but also creates culture where long hours/sacrifice become loyalty signals. Antecedent: presidential values. Consequence: normalization of extreme work hours as proof of commitment.

### 2. Texas Network as Credential
> "Well, mine is a little bit different. I'll try not to do a Genesis-through-Revelations for you. I'm a Texan. I had worked for the Bushes straight out of college, when George W. was running for Congress. So I knew a lot of the people who were close to the Bushes. I knew a lot of the Texas crowd. I had also done Party fund-raising, so I knew some of the major donors in the Republican Party, not only just in Texas, but really across the country. So I think—and you'd have to ask Chase—part of the reason why I was selected early on to do boards and commissions was there were going to be people who were terribly successful in their own right, who were not going to want to come in to the administration in a full-time capacity, but wanted to be involved in some way, i.e. a part-time board and commission." (p.5-6)

**Codes**: personal-networks, texas-connections, party-donors, name-recognition, relationship-based-selection
**Memo**: Cope's qualification = long-time Bush family connection, knowing "Texas crowd" and major donors. This is patronage system - appointments go to people in network who "wanted to be involved." Not necessarily sycophantic behavior, but structural basis for it: access based on personal loyalty history rather than expertise. Boards/commissions = reward for supporters who don't want full-time roles.

### 3. "Everybody's New Best Friend" Warning
> "The bulk of my time was really figuring out how it all worked [and] spending time with my counterparts over in presidential personnel. They were terribly helpful and pointed out some of the pitfalls, that we were going to be everybody's new best friend, and to just be mindful of that, that 'cute and charming' as we were, it wasn't necessarily our personality..." (p.8)

**Codes**: power-magnetism, insincere-flattery, reagan-alumni-advice, awareness-training
**Memo**: Reagan personnel staff warn incoming Bush staff about sycophancy FROM others - people will be "everybody's new best friend" not because of personality but because of position. Important protective factor: experienced staff warning newbies not to believe flattery. Antecedent: positional power. Consequence: if not warned, could develop inflated sense of self.

### 4. First Day: 300 Phone Calls
> "I did a lot of interviewing but my biggest challenge was the phone calls. I think, my first day, I got 300 phone calls from people, asking specifically for me. You're also trying to get the rest of your office staffed, so you're interviewing, trying to pick out the other people for your division, so you can start to delegate." (p.10)

**Codes**: overwhelming-demand, job-seeking-pressure, power-as-magnet
**Memo**: 300 phone calls first day = measure of how presidential personnel position attracts sycophantic attention. Everyone wants something. Antecedent: control over appointments. Consequence: can't do actual work, staying "incredibly late hours."

### 5. Executive Clerk's Office - Institutional Loyalty
> "You know where else you can go is—in the White House structure the keeper of everything, all the records, everything—[...] Those people are so nice. They were kind of like our godsends, because that's sort of your institutional history. [...] They're so intensely loyal to the institution." (p.3)

**Codes**: institutional-loyalty, career-staff, non-partisan-service, protective-resource
**Memo**: Career executive clerk staff described as "intensely loyal to the institution" (not to president/party). Protective factor against sycophancy - source of objective institutional memory. "Wanted so desperately to be helpful, and get you launched." Service to office, not person. Contrast to political appointees' loyalty.

### 6. Campaign People and Entitlement
> "—it's always a question of people involved in the campaign, and how to get those people who are interested in participating in a political appointment, sort of plugged in. [...] One of the key players early on in presidential personnel for us was Ron Kaufman, who had worked on the campaign and, again, had a long relationship with the Bushes and just knows everyone in politics." (p.6)

**Codes**: campaign-to-government, relationship-networks, political-knowledge-as-currency
**Memo**: Campaign workers expect to be "plugged in" to appointments. Kaufman valuable because "knows everyone in politics" AND "long relationship with Bushes." Both expertise and loyalty matter. System structured to reward campaign workers, creating expectation that early loyalty = later rewards.

### 7. Name Recognition as Critical Resource
> "So my background had really been more in terms of long-time knowledge of the Bushes, and people who were close to them. So I had quick name-recognition of people.\nMK: That's a critical thing.\nJNC: It is critical." (p.6)

**Codes**: insider-knowledge, gatekeeping-power, relationship-recognition
**Memo**: "Quick name-recognition of people" close to Bushes = critical qualification for personnel job. This is how patronage system works: you need to know who's in the network, who has claims on loyalty. Creates insider/outsider dynamic where people seek to be "known" by those with name-recognition power.

### 8. Shirley Green's Name Recognition Function
> "The other thing that was pretty helpful in terms of things just floating into the White House is the person who was head of White House correspondence was Shirley Green, and Shirley went back [to] working with the Bushes from 'forever.' Again, another Texan who knew the names and knew who was legitimate or not." (p.6)

**Codes**: texas-network, legitimacy-gatekeeping, long-time-loyalty, vetting-by-relationship
**Memo**: Shirley Green valuable because knew Bushes "from 'forever'" - could distinguish "legitimate" from illegitimate requests. Legitimacy = being known to Bush network. Gatekeeping based on personal relationships, not objective criteria. Those "known" get through, others don't.

### 9. Neustadt's "Arrogance, Ignorance and Adrenaline"
> "MK: Yes. And young people. Richard Neustadt, a political scientist, has characterized a lot of the youngest people coming into a White House as having in common their arrogance, ignorance and adrenaline.
> JNC: I saw that. Well, there's some of that. But I think so much of that—President Bush set the tone. I think every President sets the tone, for what's accepted and what's not. And he was very serious about the business of governing. He knew what he was getting into. He had been doing it as a vice president for eight years prior. So it wasn't a new experience for him and his key senior people also had had that White House experience so it wasn't a whole new territory." (p.7)

**Codes**: youth-arrogance, presidential-tone-setting, experience-as-ballast, white-house-experience-value
**Memo**: Cope acknowledges Neustadt's observation ("there's some of that") but argues Bush's tone and experience of senior staff mitigated it. Protective factor: experienced president and senior staff prevent worst excesses of young staffer arrogance. But implicit acknowledgment that without this, arrogance common among young White House staff.

### 10. Interviewing Until the Summer
> "I think, until the summer of the first year, we basically were just parked there at a minimum six days a week and working twelve-, fourteen-hour days. [...] Then, by the summer, you didn't really have to work Sundays and Saturdays; you didn't have to work quite so long and, in the evenings, you didn't have to stay quite so late. So January to about June-July, were pretty intense and then it started to back off a little bit." (p.13)

**Codes**: extreme-hours, first-year-intensity, burnout-risk, work-as-devotion
**Memo**: 14-hour days, 6 days/week for 6-7 months. Unsustainable pace. In sycophancy framework, extreme hours can be both consequence (pressure to prove loyalty/commitment) and antecedent (exhaustion impairs judgment, creates groupthink). "Parked there" language suggests lack of choice.

### 11. Multiple Sources of Pressure
> "It came from everybody. One of the challenges in presidential personnel, President Bush had said from the outset that he intended his personnel operation to be a collaboration between the White House and the agencies, that it wasn't going to be sort of dictatorial, '…you're going to take someone and you're going to love them….' [...] You've got just the sheer volume of people wanting to serve, people who are in the process and want to know, 'Have you received my paperwork, what's happened to my paperwork, when am I going to get a hearing?' Just the volume of phones and inquiries related to tracking—sorts of things." (p.14)

**Codes**: multi-directional-pressure, collaborative-vs-dictatorial, volume-overload, bush-management-style
**Memo**: Pressure from "everybody" - agencies, media, Hill, RNC, state parties, donors, cabinet secretaries. Bush's collaborative approach (anti-dictatorial) creates MORE pressure because have to negotiate rather than impose. Consequence: overwhelming volume. But collaborative approach also anti-sycophantic - not forcing agencies to take people.

### 12. Cabinet Secretaries' Pressure
> "Put the screws—getting a call from cabinet secretaries, or deputy secretaries, saying, 'Where are my people?' People on the Hill saying, 'Why hasn't my chief constituent gotten this job?' 'What's the problem over there?' People, whether it's the RNC [Republican National Committee] or state Republican parties, or whatever, hammering you about one thing or another. A major donor is out there hammering you about one thing or another." (p.15)

**Codes**: pressure-sources, patronage-claims, competing-loyalties, donor-influence
**Memo**: Multiple competing sycophantic pressures: Cabinet secretaries ("my people"), Hill ("my chief constituent"), RNC, state parties, "major donors." Everyone claiming ownership/priority. Antecedent: patronage system where different actors have different bases for claims. Consequence: personnel staff caught in middle, must manage competing sycophantic demands.

### 13. Campaign Workers After Elections
> "The other thing that happens is, every campaign cycle, you're dealing with campaign people who were very helpful to the President, and didn't get reelected. So there is that influx of, 'What to do with Joe or Betsy who were there for us when we needed them and there aren't any openings…', and you're told to get creative." (p.14)

**Codes**: campaign-loyalty-debts, creative-placement, loyalty-as-currency, patronage-obligations
**Memo**: Explicit patronage - "helpful to the President" in campaign creates obligation to find jobs. "Told to get creative" = directive to reward loyalty even when no appropriate openings. Campaign loyalty as currency for appointments. Classic patronage-based sycophancy antecedent: early support creates claims on later rewards.

### 14. "Nine Enemies and One Ingrate"
> "We joked a lot about that, that for every appointment you make you get—
> MK: Nine enemies.
> JNC: —nine enemies and one ingrate. I guess that was true to some extent but, as someone who was in that job for four years and has stayed in Washington and is involved in recruiting even now, I have found that that hadn't really been a problem. I guess there are some people out there, maybe, who are harboring terrible ill will toward me because I prevented them being Secretary of State, but no one really jumps to mind." (p.18)

**Codes**: appointment-politics, resentment-management, personnel-saying, long-term-relationships
**Memo**: Classic personnel saying acknowledges that most don't get jobs they want (nine enemies) and even successful appointee ungrateful (one ingrate). But Cope's four-year tenure and continued DC career suggest she managed this well. Protective factor: treating people decently even when saying no. Humor about "prevented them being Secretary of State" shows perspective.

### 15. Bathroom Stall Resume
> "I had gone to this thing. You're black tie. You have some little baby purse that basically has your lipstick and enough money to get out of the parking garage. Some woman—I'm not kidding. I had gone to the restroom and somebody backed me into a stall with their resume. I thought okay, this is why I don't go out. I thought, 'This is ridiculous.' Just cornered me. Just kept talking, pressing their resume on me and I just kept backing up. I thought, 'Okay, this takes the cake.'" (p.22)

**Codes**: aggressive-job-seeking, public-pressure, avoiding-events, boundary-violation
**Memo**: Extreme example of job-seeking sycophancy - woman literally corners Cope in bathroom stall with resume at Senate-House dinner. Shows desperation/aggressiveness of people seeking appointments. Consequence: personnel staff avoid public events to escape "bombardment." Position creates constant pressure from sycophantic job-seekers.

### 16. Avoiding Travel and Public Events
> "MK: So I guess one of the things you did not—Chase had talked about not traveling with the President.
> JNC: You don't. [First], you don't really have a reason to. There is so much—people come to you to interview. You don't go out to them, unlike the private sector, where you jump around and go see people wherever they are. Just every minute counted. It really was a volume issue, particularly early on. No. People in presidential personnel would tend not to travel." (p.22)

**Codes**: travel-avoidance, volume-management, accessibility-as-burden
**Memo**: Personnel staff don't travel with president partly because "people come to you" (power magnetism) and partly to avoid being approached. Volume so overwhelming that going out would make it worse. Position creates sycophantic attention that must be actively managed by limiting public exposure.

### 17. Church and Restaurants
> "MK: I guess you must have developed defensive strategies. Did you find people would go after you in restaurants or that sort of thing?
> JNC: Yes. Church.
> MK: Church, too.
> JNC: It's tough. And I didn't resent it, because I understood it, other than getting backed into the restroom. It's just, there are only so many hours in a day." (p.22-23)

**Codes**: constant-pressure, boundary-erosion, understanding-vs-resenting, defensive-strategies
**Memo**: Job-seekers approach at restaurants and church - no sacred spaces. Cope "didn't resent it" because "understood it" - empathy for those seeking jobs. But still requires "defensive strategies." Consequence of power position: normal social interactions become opportunities for sycophantic approaches. Must develop defenses while maintaining empathy.

### 18. Personal Relationship as Reason for Serving
> "This is going to sound really corny. For me, I had worked for this man and his family a million years ago, so the opportunity to serve—. I was there because of my relationship with him and with Mrs. [Barbara] Bush. So it was a different dynamic. I wasn't someone in Washington who has jumped in or out, and maybe this puts you in a better position to do X." (p.21)

**Codes**: personal-loyalty, service-to-person, relationship-basis, bush-family-connection
**Memo**: Cope explicit that she was there "because of my relationship with him and with Mrs. Bush." Service to person/family, not to position or policy. Different from career advancement motive. This IS sycophancy in sense of personal loyalty, but also genuine long-term relationship. Shows patronage can be based on authentic relationships, not just transactional.

### 19. White House Perks
> "The other perks that go with it, you got a nice parking spot. There's the mess. [...] But if you need to entertain people, they're impressed. It's also helpful—Mr. Bush or Mrs. Bush would periodically drop in and eat in the mess, so that was always a thrill for people. You could go to some cool things. You had some invitations to things." (p.21)

**Codes**: perks-of-proximity, status-symbols, access-as-benefit, presidential-contact
**Memo**: Benefits = parking, mess (where people "impressed"), seeing famous people, president/first lady dropping in ("always a thrill"), invitations. Proximity to power as reward. These perks can foster sycophancy - people value access/proximity for its own sake, use it to impress others. "Thrill" of Bush dropping in = deference to presidential presence.

### 20. Bush's Guilt After Election Loss
> "I was with President Bush on election day—there were a lot of different emotions, but part of it was he felt so badly about the people who worked for him. There was a huge sense of that. [...] 'Is there anything I can do to help you?'" (p.20)

**Codes**: presidential-responsibility, empathy-for-staff, personal-connection, loyalty-reciprocity
**Memo**: Bush felt personally responsible for staff losing jobs after election loss. Offering help to individuals. Contrast to transactional sycophancy - this is genuine mutual loyalty. Bush reciprocates staff loyalty by feeling guilty and offering help. Protective factor against worst sycophancy: leader who cares about people as people, not just instruments.

### 21. Chase's Deliberate Slowness
> "Chase told us from day one, 'This is going to be a deliberative process, be prepared. We will be beat up by the press for being slugs in terms of the pace of our appointments, but the president has clearly instructed me get it right; I don't want surprises; I don't want to hurt people. I want to get good people in these positions and it may take you a little while, fine.' So Chase said, 'I'm going to be pilloried in the press for being the slowest person who ever drew a breath, but I'd rather be slow than get killed for doing a stupid appointment.'" (p.15)

**Codes**: deliberate-vetting, quality-over-speed, presidential-directive, media-pressure-resistance
**Memo**: Untermeyer's deliberate approach (covered in his interview) reinforced here. Bush directive: "get it right; I don't want surprises; I don't want to hurt people." Anti-sycophantic in prioritizing quality over pleasing media/constituencies. Protective factor: leadership willing to take criticism for thoroughness. Prevents rushed appointments to reward loyalists.

### 22. Staff Stability
> "Martha had the natural resources portfolio. She had Agriculture, Interior, EPA [Environmental Protection Agency], Energy. Again, things that thematically fit together. The national security portfolio would have been State, Defense, AID [Agency for International Development], things grouped there. [...] Martha Goodwin who stayed in—that's another thing that was kind of unusual. So many of the associate directors served all four years, which is really unusual." (p.11)

**Codes**: staff-retention, unusual-stability, continuity-value, institutional-memory
**Memo**: Associate directors serving all four years "really unusual" and "very helpful." Untermeyer got commitment to stay minimum one year. Stability = protective factor against sycophancy. Prevents people from cherry-picking next jobs, maintains institutional memory, ensures follow-through. Contrast to typical 18-month churn.

### 23. Boyden Gray's Counsel Office Effectiveness
> "Boyden's shop was really great about that. They were just really good at what they did. Again, there was a lot of stability in that office. People tended to come and stay. I think it's grueling, but I think it makes a difference, because you're not passing something off, half done, to someone who's new. There's a lot more continuity, so things don't slip through the cracks inadvertently." (p.17)

**Codes**: counsel-office-quality, staff-stability, continuity-value, preventing-slips
**Memo**: Gray's counsel office praised for stability and quality. No ethical surprises or leaks from their vetting. Protective factor: professional, stable counsel office prevents appointment of people with problems. Continuity prevents things slipping through cracks. Institutional competence as protection against patronage mistakes.

### 24. Chief of Staff Differences
> "I think it makes a big difference. Again, you have the tone set by that person and their relationship to the President I think is really key. Some people are known and perceived to be terribly close to the President. Does that person really speak for the President? There's always sort of that 'whose agenda is this? Is this the President's or the Chief of Staff's?'" (p.27)

**Codes**: chief-of-staff-power, tone-setting, presidential-relationship, agenda-questions
**Memo**: Chief of staff's perceived closeness to president affects whether they're seen as speaking for president or pursuing own agenda. Sycophancy question: do people defer to chief because of position or because genuinely close to president? "Whose agenda is this?" = awareness that chief of staff power can be self-serving vs. presidential service.

### 25. Texas Network Throughout White House
> "Shirley Green. Jim Cicconi. David Bates. Bob Estrada. Fred McClure. I had known Andy [Card], but not from Texas, obviously. [...] Some of these people you spent so much time with, you can't even remember when you first met. Chase, obviously. A lot of these people, I knew from just having been around the Bushes. [...] Those are some of the ones who jump to mind immediately, particularly as I look at this organization chart. But David Bates certainly falls in that category." (p.27)

**Codes**: texas-network, bush-family-orbit, long-term-relationships, patronage-network
**Memo**: Extensive Texas network throughout Bush White House - people known "from just having been around the Bushes." This is structural patronage - positions filled by people from Bush's personal orbit. Not necessarily sycophantic behavior, but creates insider culture. "Can't even remember when you first met" = relationships so long-standing they're taken for granted.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Personal Networks as Qualification**: Texas connections, Bush family relationships, and name recognition of donors/supporters as primary credentials
2. **Campaign Loyalty as Currency**: Campaign workers expected appointments; "helpful to President" created obligations
3. **Power as Magnet**: 300 calls first day; approached at church, restaurants, backed into bathroom stall with resume
4. **Multiple Competing Pressures**: Cabinet secretaries, Hill, RNC, state parties, donors all "hammering" for their people
5. **Protective Factors**:
   - Career staff "intensely loyal to institution"
   - Deliberate vetting despite media criticism
   - Staff stability (unusual 4-year tenure)
   - Bush's collaborative vs. dictatorial approach
   - Professional counsel office
6. **Patronage Obligations**: Finding jobs for defeated politicians who helped president; boards/commissions for successful donors who wanted involvement
7. **Personal Loyalty**: Cope there "because of relationship" with Bush family; Bush felt guilty about staff after loss
8. **Position Perks**: Parking, mess, presidential contact, invitations - proximity to power as benefit

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Long-term personal relationships with Bush family
- Campaign work creating loyalty debts
- Texas network as insider credential
- Control over thousands of appointments
- Donor expectations of involvement
- Multiple actors with patronage claims

**Manifestations**:
- Job-seekers approaching at church, restaurants, events
- Resume in bathroom stall
- 300 phone calls first day
- "Everybody's new best friend" phenomenon
- Cabinet secretaries claiming "my people"
- Donors "hammering" for positions

**Consequences**:
- 14-hour days, 6-7 days/week for months
- Avoiding public events to escape pressure
- Need for "defensive strategies"
- "Nine enemies and one ingrate"
- Difficulty transitioning out (huge influx unemployed Republicans)
- Creative placement of campaign workers

**Protective Factors**:
- Reagan personnel alumni warning about flattery
- Executive clerk staff loyal to institution not person
- Deliberate vetting prioritizing quality over speed
- Collaborative rather than dictatorial approach
- Staff stability (4-year tenure unusual)
- Professional counsel office preventing scandals
- Bush's empathy and sense of responsibility to staff
- Personal relationships based on genuine history not transactional

## Broader Significance

This interview reveals patronage-based sycophancy that's fundamentally different from fear-based (Nixon/Haldeman) or power-intoxication (Reagan/Griscom) types:

1. **Relationship-Based System**: Appointments flow through personal networks (Texas connections, Bush family orbit, major donors). Not merit-based but not necessarily corrupt - based on longstanding genuine relationships.

2. **Campaign Loyalty as Obligation**: System structured so early support creates legitimate claims on later rewards. "Helpful to President" = debt to be paid. Different from pure merit but understood as proper reciprocity.

3. **Multiple Competing Sycophancies**: Unlike hierarchical systems where sycophancy flows one direction (toward leader), patronage creates competing claims - cabinet secretaries, senators, donors, party officials all demanding "their" appointments.

4. **Power as Magnet**: Personnel positions attract overwhelming sycophantic attention from job-seekers. 300 calls, bathroom stall resume, church approaches = constant pressure requiring defensive strategies.

5. **Protective Factors Matter**: Despite patronage structure, Bush administration avoided worst excesses through:
   - Deliberate vetting
   - Career staff institutional loyalty
   - Collaborative approach
   - Professional counsel office
   - Leaders who felt responsible for people

6. **Personal Loyalty vs. Transactional**: Cope's service "because of relationship" with Bushes shows patronage can be based on genuine long-term loyalty, not just careerism. Bush feeling guilty after loss shows reciprocal care.

This provides important comparative case: patronage-based sycophancy creates different dynamics than fear-based (Nixon) or intoxication-based (Reagan). The key variable may be whether leaders see staff as instruments vs. people with genuine mutual obligations.
