# Richard M. Nixon Transition - Gerald L. Warren Interview
**Date**: October 18, 1999
**Interviewee**: Gerald L. Warren (Deputy Press Secretary, Nixon; Director of Communications, Ford)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Warren discusses his experience as Deputy Press Secretary during Nixon and Director of Communications under Ford, focusing on press operations, Watergate briefings, transition dynamics, and the challenges of serving without campaign credentials. Key themes include outsider status, institutional memory, credibility under crisis, "them vs. us" mentality, and the dangers of staff losing perspective.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Outsider Status - Not "In the Trenches"
> "I was advised by a very wise person who had been through this before to skip the inauguration festivities because I wasn't a member of the team. I wasn't in the campaign. I was told that I was going to be initially viewed as an outsider who wasn't in the trenches with the [Richard] Nixon folks so I should go in as quietly as possible. So I did. That turned out to be true. I was a newspaper editor. I wasn't identified as a Nixon person. I had to overcome that within the staff." (p.1)

**Codes**: outsider-status, campaign-loyalty, proving-oneself, professional-vs-political
**Memo**: Warren explicitly told to be quiet because he lacked campaign credentials - "wasn't in the trenches." This loyalty-based hierarchy creates pressure to prove oneself, potentially through sycophantic displays. Antecedent: not being part of campaign. Consequence: had to "overcome that within the staff" - earn acceptance despite expertise.

### 2. Institutional Memory vs. Political Loyalty
> "There's always someone in each office, some secretary in each office, who has the key, who knows how it works. The difficult thing is to find that person and then, in the case of a Republican administration replacing a Democrat or vice versa, protecting that person and saying please help us. Each of us going in, in those circumstances, seems to make the same mistake. They move these people away as if they were [Lyndon B.] Johnson loyalists. Well, she may or may not have been but she knew how the place worked; she was willing and eager to share that with us. It took us about a week of stumbling around before we brought her back in to a prominent position in the press office." (p.1)

**Codes**: institutional-memory, political-suspicion, learning-from-mistakes, Connie-Gerard
**Memo**: Classic tension between political loyalty and institutional competence. New staff initially suspicious of holdovers (potential loyalty to predecessor = sycophancy concern), but expertise proves essential. Antecedent: partisan transition. Consequence: self-inflicted wounds from purging institutional knowledge. Anti-sycophancy lesson: trust professional expertise over political credentials.

### 3. Cross-Administration Knowledge Sharing
> "I think you must trust the people that you are replacing regardless of the circumstances. Whether you were opponents in the campaign or whether you're just political opponents, when they're going out they probably will be willing to tell you the truth about how the operation works. We were willing to tell Jody the truth. I wasn't there at the transition but I called him and offered my advice. He finally squeezed me in for a quick drink. I told him to keep Connie; he made some crude remark which I took offense to but I came back to him; I said, 'You really are making a mistake if you don't lean on her.'" (p.1-2)

**Codes**: cross-party-cooperation, institutional-service, professional-integrity, transition-advice
**Memo**: Warren reached out to Carter's Jody Powell despite political differences - anti-sycophantic professionalism serving institution over party. Powell initially dismissive ("crude remark") but Warren persisted. Protective factor: commitment to institutional functioning transcends partisan loyalty.

### 4. Ziegler's Insecurity About Klein
> "Ron being the younger, more aggressive person didn't want a Herb Klein person as his deputy so he didn't go to Herb. I think there was some jealousy there at the beginning. But he went to Castanet and to a mutual friend of ours in the PR [public relations] business in Los Angeles whom I had known for a long time and so had Ron. He suggested he talk to me as a person who could be independent and journalistically experienced. So he did. He asked me to come back and talk to Ron at the Pierre Hotel in New York during the interregnum. [...] One of the questions was, 'You're working for me now, not for Herb. You understand that, don't you?' I said, 'Yes, I understand that. I don't want to stop being friends with Herb Klein, because I admire him greatly.' He said, 'That's fine. But you're working for me, and not for Herb.' He wanted that very clear." (p.8)

**Codes**: hierarchical-insecurity, loyalty-demands, professional-independence, reporting-relationships
**Memo**: Ziegler's insistence "you're working for me, not for Herb" repeated multiple times shows insecurity about Klein's influence. Sycophancy dynamics: younger, less experienced Ziegler demanding exclusive loyalty from more seasoned hire. Warren's independence (maintaining Klein friendship) vs. Ziegler's need for clear hierarchical deference.

### 5. Dual Suspicion - Nixon Staff and Press
> "There was a great suspicion of me throughout the White House staff because I was one of 'them.' Almost immediately I recognized this growing animosity between the President's staff and the press even though at that time the President-elect and then the President was getting very good press. [...] The Nixon folks at first didn't really trust me and the press didn't either. I've lived with that all my life. It's just something that stayed with me after I left the White House as well." (p.9)

**Codes**: dual-suspicion, identity-ambiguity, journalist-in-government, trust-deficit
**Memo**: Warren caught between two worlds - Nixon staff suspicious because of journalism background ("one of 'them'"), press suspicious because joined Nixon. Classic non-sycophant position: trusted by neither side because not fully committed to either. Consequence: "lived with that all my life" - permanent outsider status.

### 6. Winning Over Staff Through Competence
> "First of all, you have to win over the White House staff and you don't do that by any untoward declarations of fealty to the President; you do it simply by exposing them to what you think are the best practices of dealing with the press corps and telling them how it's much better that we get our story out in a way that is understandable and clear." (p.9)

**Codes**: earning-trust-through-competence, anti-sycophancy-approach, professional-credibility
**Memo**: Warren explicitly rejects "declarations of fealty" as path to acceptance. Instead: demonstrate value through expertise. Anti-sycophantic strategy working within sycophantic environment. Contrast to typical approach of proving loyalty through deference.

### 7. Watergate Briefings - Stonewalling
> "Then I would get the one or two paragraphs from Ron Ziegler who was then acting as an assistant to the President who had sat with the President that morning saying these questions are going to come up about Watergate. Then what we said was the President said this, period. We didn't go beyond that. [...] So we kept it very brief, this is the President's position. Then I would stonewall. That term was really originated and gained great currency during that time." (p.4)

**Codes**: stonewalling, limited-information, defensive-posture, Watergate-communications
**Memo**: "Stonewall" - giving minimal information, refusing elaboration. This isn't sycophancy but consequence of sycophantic system where questioning/challenging president's position internally is impossible. Warren executing orders rather than shaping strategy. Result: credibility damage.

### 8. Individual vs. Institutional Credibility
> "Well, as an individual I think I did have credibility but as a spokesman for the President it was terrible. [...] You had to stand there and let them vent some spleen because they were upset; they wanted more. The metaphor I tried to live by in those days, which sometimes was difficult, was that there was sort of a channel, think of it as an air tube between the White House Press Office acting for the President and the press acting for the public and the information had to keep flowing through that channel even when it was cluttered and clogged up by Watergate." (p.4-5)

**Codes**: personal-vs-institutional-credibility, information-flow, role-conflict, Watergate-impact
**Memo**: Warren distinguishes his personal credibility (intact) from institutional credibility (destroyed). He's trapped serving dishonest president while maintaining personal integrity. Anti-sycophantic stance: keeping "channel" open despite being used to mislead. Tension between loyalty and honesty.

### 9. Trudeau Cartoon - The Stonew all
> "I'll never forget [Gary] Trudeau—I can laugh now; it wasn't that funny then—had a series of strips about the White House. It was always the White House says, the White House says. He even had these statements coming out of the White House with no person involved. But the theme that linked them all together was a stone wall that was being built around the White House. Every day it got taller and taller and taller. It was really very clever." (p.4-5)

**Codes**: public-perception, stonewalling-imagery, impersonal-statements, defensive-isolation
**Memo**: Trudeau's cartoon captures sycophancy consequence: faceless institutional voice shielding president from accountability. "The White House says" - no individual responsibility, perfect sycophantic structure. Visual metaphor of rising wall = increasing isolation and defensiveness.

### 10. Klein's Office Created as Loyalty Reward
> MK: "When Herb Klein came in, was there an understanding in some way that that office was created for him—"
> GW: "Yes."
> MK: "—because the President needed to have him or felt as loyalty he should have him but he didn't really want him doing the press work?"
> GW: "Yes. Beyond that, he had come up with a really good idea of helping the various spokesmen in the branches do their job better." (p.10)

**Codes**: loyalty-reward, organizational-structure, Klein-role, sinecure
**Memo**: Director of Communications position created for Klein because Nixon "felt as loyalty he should have him" but didn't want him as Press Secretary. Classic sycophancy structure: reward loyalist with title/office while limiting actual influence. Klein made useful but marginalized.

### 11. Mistrust Between Press and Communications Offices
> "Again—I'm sure Ron will readily agree with what I'm about to say—there was a mistrust between the two offices because the White House always thinks if it's really good news, we should announce it or if it's really bad news, they should announce it." (p.10)

**Codes**: inter-office-rivalry, credit-claiming, blame-shifting, organizational-sycophancy
**Memo**: Classic bureaucratic sycophancy - offices competing to take credit for good news, avoid blame for bad. "We should announce it" = claiming proximity to success. Antecedent: hierarchical competition for presidential favor. Consequence: coordination problems.

### 12. Impossible Press Conference Preparation
> "I don't know. They get busy. They'd rather not think about it. It does take a lot of preparation. [...] The briefing book which Pat Buchanan did in the Nixon years and which I did for the first year of the Ford administration—Margita White did it after I did—was very, very complete. Every domestic agency and State, Defense and Treasury would send in their ideas of what the questions were and their proposed answers. [...] Then it went to the President who put in his two cents worth in and then it was revised again after that. Ford never did that. Once we sent it to Ford, he never sent it back." (p.22)

**Codes**: press-conference-prep, presidential-avoidance, staff-burden, Ford-vs-Nixon
**Memo**: Extensive preparation but Nixon still avoided press conferences. Sycophantic dynamic: massive staff effort producing briefing book president won't engage with. Ford's non-engagement different - trusts staff vs. Nixon's need to control but refusal to prepare. Both frustrate staff serving function.

### 13. Vulnerability and Agony
> "I don't know. He may have. It was agony for him, I know that. You could see it in his face. It was very, very difficult." (p.23)

**Codes**: presidential-vulnerability, press-conference-anxiety, visible-stress
**Memo**: Nixon's discomfort with press conferences visible. Creates sycophancy pressure - staff protect president from painful exposure. Consequence: fewer conferences, less accountability. Antecedent: president's psychological discomfort. Protective sycophancy enabling avoidance.

### 14. No Notes - Image Management
> "He may have gone over the diagram in advance. He didn't take it with him to the podium. He wanted nothing on the podium. He wanted to be known as someone who responded without notes, without guidance." (p.23)

**Codes**: image-management, appearing-strong, no-notes, performance-over-substance
**Memo**: Nixon's insistence on appearing to answer without assistance - performance of competence over actual competence. Staff must enable this theater. Sycophantic dynamic: extensive prep behind scenes to maintain fiction of spontaneous mastery.

### 15. Christmas Party - Nixon Affected by Alcohol
> "It almost became a disaster because he was [inaudible] man and that was fine, but it was the first time I had seen him drink. He had no capacity. He couldn't have—he was proud of Manolo's martinis. He said Manolo makes the best martinis in the world. So a couple of guys had martinis and so did he. It began to affect him. I wondered about him later on, whether he had a problem. He didn't have a problem; he was just affected [inaudible] by a drink. [...] His jocularity rose an octave or two. He was just trying to be a good guy and that's not—as they say over and over again, he wasn't much for small talk but he was trying to make small talk with these people. There was almost a forced gaiety to it." (p.32)

**Codes**: Nixon-drinking, forced-sociability, staff-protection, presidential-weakness
**Memo**: Rare moment of Nixon vulnerability - low alcohol tolerance, awkward socializing, "forced gaiety." Staff protective: Warren defends him when asked if president was drunk. Sycophantic covering: "The President of the United [States] was tired, he had a drink, and he was relaxing; he wasn't really drinking." Protecting presidential image even in retrospect.

### 16. "Them vs. Us" Mentality
> "It wasn't triggered by Watergate; it was triggered well before that. It was triggered by the Vietnam protests. That's when the 'them versus us' feeling set in in the White House; it was really cemented in the White House during that time because people were mystified at why they didn't recognize that this man was trying to get us out of Vietnam honorably and the youngsters in the street, the youngsters marching around the White House complex throwing stones over the buses, didn't understand that." (p.9)

**Codes**: siege-mentality, us-vs-them, Vietnam-protests, embattlement, self-righteousness
**Memo**: Classic sycophancy antecedent - external threats creating "them versus us" mentality. Staff convinced they're right, protesters/press "didn't understand." Self-righteousness enables groupthink. Antecedent: Vietnam protests. Consequence: increasing isolation, defensiveness, eventual Watergate mindset.

### 17. Power Intoxication Warning
> "I think this whole business that has affected some White Houses more than others and I think is something to guard against is the, 'them versus us.' Carter went through that; others have as well. I think the equanimity factor has to come into play here and you have to recognize that politics is important and is vital but there are a lot of other aspects in life that are important as well, and if we make too much of our own role and everything becomes so important to the exclusion of other things, then the opposition that is normal in today's politics, even a quarter of a century ago, becomes more evil, and that shouldn't happen." (p.36)

**Codes**: perspective-loss, self-importance, opposition-as-evil, work-life-balance, lesson-learned
**Memo**: Warren's reflection on sycophancy danger: making "too much of our own role" so "opposition...becomes more evil." Loss of perspective from total immersion. Antecedent: 15-17 hour days, six-seven day weeks, "everything concentrated around it." Consequence: normal political opposition becomes existential threat. Anti-sycophancy lesson learned too late.

### 18. Long Hours and Lost Perspective
> "Well, when you're in town, you work at least six days a week and when you're on the road, you work seven. During the week we were almost always there for fifteen, sixteen, seventeen hours a day, sometimes more. [...] And I think is something to guard against is the, 'them versus us.' [...] Perhaps I let it affect me too much and if I had this thing to do all over again, I would try to have more of a life outside the White House than I did. Everything was concentrated around it." (p.36)

**Codes**: overwork, lost-perspective, no-outside-life, total-immersion, regret
**Memo**: Warren's chief regret: "Everything was concentrated around it." Total immersion destroyed perspective, enabled "them vs. us" mentality. Sycophancy through exhaustion and isolation. Antecedent: extreme work hours. Consequence: loss of external reference points, increasing radicalization. Protective factor he missed: maintaining life outside White House.

### 19. Believing in the President
> "It's terribly hard because you sign on to work for a president and therefore you believe in him or her, as the case may be in the future. And you want that person to prevail; you want that person to be right, because you feel that the country has confidence in that person's guidance and leadership." (p.36-37)

**Codes**: true-belief, wanting-president-to-prevail, country-stake, mission-commitment
**Memo**: Warren articulates sycophancy's psychological foundation: "you want that person to be right" not just politically but morally. Stakes raised by invoking country - president's success = national success. Makes dissent feel like betrayal. Genuine commitment ("you believe in him") becomes trap when president is wrong.

### 20. System Survives Despite Bad Policies and People
> "You learn so much about our country and about us as a people, about our strengths and our weaknesses and how our weaknesses are not ever strong enough to weaken the form of government that our forefathers gave us. We've seen bad policies and suspect people and all sorts of things and the system seems to be able to survive, which is terrific." (p.37)

**Codes**: institutional-resilience, system-survives, bad-policies, suspect-people, perspective
**Memo**: Warren's ultimate anti-sycophancy insight: "bad policies and suspect people" including presumably Nixon, but system survived. Perspective gained through experience: individual presidents matter less than sycophants believe. Protective wisdom: institutions transcend individuals, reducing stakes of loyalty conflicts.

### 21. Understanding Successors
> "Also, to get back to your purposes, there is also a great understanding of what the present people are going through, whether you are fond of their policies or not. You know what they're going through, and you can appreciate when they do it better than you do. McCurry certainly did it so much better than we did. Much better." (p.37)

**Codes**: empathy-across-administrations, learning-from-successors, professional-respect, humility
**Memo**: Anti-sycophancy through professional community spanning administrations. Warren respects McCurry despite partisan differences - "did it so much better than we did." Humility about own performance. Transcends partisan sycophancy for professional standards. Protective factor: professional identity beyond political loyalty.

### 22. McCurry's Equanimity and Humor
> "Well, I think, equanimity is one thing. McCurry kept his cool in ways that were admirable. I think his ability to use humor in dark hours was very important, which we could not bring ourselves to do, because we were so embattled and, to a certain extent, embarrassed." (p.37)

**Codes**: equanimity, humor-under-pressure, embattlement, embarrassment, defensive-posture
**Memo**: Warren identifies what they lacked: equanimity, humor. "We could not bring ourselves to do" this because "so embattled and, to a certain extent, embarrassed." Sycophancy consequence: when defending indefensible, can't maintain lightness. Embarrassment (knowing you're wrong) prevents humor. McCurry's humor possible because less personally invested/embarrassed?

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Outsider Status**: Not being "in the trenches" (campaign) created suspicion, pressure to prove loyalty
2. **Institutional Memory vs. Political Loyalty**: Tension between expertise and partisan credentials
3. **Dual Suspicion**: Caught between Nixon staff (suspicious of journalist background) and press (suspicious of joining Nixon)
4. **Personal vs. Institutional Credibility**: Warren maintained individual integrity while institutional credibility collapsed
5. **Stonewalling**: Executing defensive strategy that damaged credibility
6. **"Them vs. Us" Mentality**: Siege mentality from Vietnam protests, Watergate intensifying isolation
7. **Total Immersion**: 15-17 hour days, six-seven day weeks destroying perspective
8. **Lost Perspective**: "Everything concentrated around it" enabling radicalization
9. **Equanimity Lost**: Embattlement and embarrassment preventing humor, maintaining defensiveness
10. **Learning Across Administrations**: Professional community spanning partisan divides

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Not being campaign loyalist (outsider pressure to prove oneself)
- Vietnam protests creating siege mentality
- Watergate scandal creating embattlement
- Total work immersion (15-17 hour days)
- No life outside White House
- Believing president must prevail for country's sake

**Manifestations**:
- Stonewalling at briefings
- "Them vs. us" mentality
- Defending president's drinking (protective lying)
- Making opposition seem evil rather than normal
- Total work devotion as loyalty display
- Faceless institutional voice ("The White House says")

**Consequences**:
- Lost individual vs. institutional credibility distinction
- Permanent outsider status (trusted by neither side)
- Regret over lost perspective
- "Lived with that all my life" - lasting damage from association
- Increasing isolation and defensiveness
- Watergate outcome

**Protective Factors**:
- Journalism background providing independent professional identity
- Explicitly rejecting "declarations of fealty"
- Earning trust through competence not loyalty displays
- Maintaining outside friendships (Klein) despite pressure
- Cross-administration professional community
- Learning from successors (respecting McCurry)
- Ultimate insight: system survives "bad policies and suspect people"
- Humility about own performance
- Recognizing need for outside life and perspective

**Anti-Sycophancy Lessons**:
- Trust institutional expertise over political credentials (Connie Gerard example)
- Maintain life outside work to preserve perspective
- Guard against "them vs. us" mentality
- Recognize opposition as normal, not evil
- Don't make "too much of our own role"
- Serve institution across administrations, not just one president
- Maintain equanimity and humor even in dark hours
