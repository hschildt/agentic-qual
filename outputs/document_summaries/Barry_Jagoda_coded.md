## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Carter's Self-Confidence and Arrogance
> "Carter said, 'What is it that you can do for me?' He's, of course, very straightforward, probing, and right to the point. I said, well, I probably wouldn't do anything specific for him; he was fairly well spoken and I didn't think he needed any image help, but I understood the requirements of the media, and I'd try to help on that side. He sort of absorbed that for a minute and said that sounds right. In other words, he was a bit arrogant about his own abilities: 'I don't need any help; I'm fine; there is a lot of press hanging around me and maybe you can help with that.'" (p.2)

**Codes**: leader-self-confidence, rejection-of-image-making, arrogance, anti-sycophantic-leader
**Memo**: Carter explicitly rejects the idea that he needs help with his image or presentation - "I don't need any help; I'm fine." This is anti-sycophantic in that he doesn't want staff to flatter or manipulate his image. But it also reveals arrogance that may prevent him from accepting useful advice. Antecedent: personal confidence. Consequence: staff role becomes facilitating media access rather than shaping image.

### 2. Anti-Sycophantic Philosophy on Image-Making
> "I was more interested in understanding how the broadcast organizations were working and trying to accommodate their needs to our needs and vice versa. I always thought the idea of image-making was ridiculous. You don't take a mature adult and turn him around. Even though there's a lot emphasis on that in the commentary about the presidency and what have you, I never thought it was successful. I thought that, any time you did try to get into manipulating the personality, you ended up causing trouble. So I tried to stay away from that." (p.3)

**Codes**: anti-manipulation, authenticity-over-image, facilitation-vs-control, professional-integrity
**Memo**: Jagoda articulates explicitly anti-sycophantic approach - rejects manipulating the candidate's personality or creating false images. Believes in facilitating rather than controlling. This is protective factor against sycophancy. His journalism background creates professional norms against propaganda.

### 3. Carter's Genuine Responsiveness vs. Overexposure Debate
> "This became a very contentious matter years later, in the third year of the Carter presidency, when it was thought by some, including by Rosalynn Carter, that the President was overexposed and that he would answer a question at the drop of a hat. I thought that was the key to his success, which was that he was a genuine, natural person who would respond to anyone on any subject. But there were those who felt that he needed to have a few issues and focus on a few issues." (p.3)

**Codes**: openness-debate, authenticity-vs-strategy, rosalynn-influence, overexposure-concern
**Memo**: Tension between Carter's natural openness (anti-sycophantic - won't just say what's strategic) and staff desire for message control (would be more sycophantic to demands of political strategy). Rosalynn and others wanted more control; Jagoda defended openness as strength. Shows competing visions of how president should relate to public.

### 4. Watson-Jordan Transition Feud
> "So the Transition Office opened and we had a formal opening. Two hundred reporters showed up and we had the presentation by the transition director. He said, 'We're here to make great government.' I said, 'I'm happy to help you with questions you might have and what-have-you.' Dozens of articles were written about this: 'Jimmy Carter's government has come to town; Jack Watson has announced elaborate plans.' I didn't get into trouble over this but this was the beginning of a fierce feud, later became a famous feud, between the guy who had run the campaign, Hamilton Jordan, and this fellow Watson who had come to Washington to take over. That went on for three months. I was kind of in the middle of it, trying to say nothing." (p.6)

**Codes**: watson-jordan-feud, loyalty-vs-expertise, transition-power-struggle, campaign-vs-transition
**Memo**: Classic sycophancy tension - who has the right to president's loyalty? Jordan (campaign manager) felt threatened by Watson (transition director) who appeared to be "taking over." Antecedent: Carter didn't get Jordan's buy-in for Watson appointment. Consequence: three months of staff conflict, appearing as disarray. Jagoda caught in middle, trying to avoid choosing sides.

### 5. Watson's Competence Creating Perception Problem
> "The line was there would be no Chief of Staff. We would have no [H. R.] Haldeman. We would have no Chief of Staff. But certainly he would play a large role in the government, in the White House operation. He was very bright and very capable. So when he would be asked a question, he would provide a decisive and intelligent answer; the result of which was he sounded like he was trying to take over. He really wasn't, particularly, although he did want to show that the group was capable of governing." (p.6-7)

**Codes**: competence-as-threat, anti-haldeman-symbolism, answering-decisively, expertise-vs-loyalty
**Memo**: Watson's competence and decisiveness made him sound like he was "taking over" - his refusal to be deferential or uncertain created political problem. This is anti-sycophantic behavior (being competent and decisive) punished in context where campaign loyalists expect deference. Shows how demonstrating expertise can be perceived as disloyalty.

### 6. Lesson on Symbolic vs. Substantive Organizational Choices
> "I think the lesson here is: that if you are, for political purposes, doing something which is different from what your predecessor in office did—'We won't have a chief of staff, because we don't run a tight ship like that; we have a variety of voices…'—it's important to make sure that it's thought out carefully, and that you don't make great substantive errors in the interest of political benefit. That's what happened, really; there'd be no chief of staff. So early parts of the Carter White House seemed to be in disarray." (p.7)

**Codes**: symbolic-rejection-backfiring, organizational-dysfunction, no-chief-of-staff-problems, political-vs-functional
**Memo**: Jagoda reflects that rejecting Haldeman-style chief of staff for symbolic/political reasons created real organizational problems. Antecedent: desire to distance from Nixon's hierarchical model. Consequence: appearance of disarray, later need to create hierarchy anyway. Shows tension between anti-sycophantic ideal (no gatekeeper) and functional necessity.

### 7. Powell-Jagoda "Two Chances" System
> "Sometimes, as a matter of fact, Powell might ask Carter to do something, and Carter would decline. Powell would then say, 'Why don't you try it with a little different approach?' In other words, it was a side door. That model later evolved into the way we operated in the White House. Essentially, Powell had two chances on some issues. That was very helpful." (p.4)

**Codes**: second-chance-system, strategic-persuasion, working-around-refusals, powell-jagoda-coordination
**Memo**: Strategic system for getting around Carter's initial "no" - Powell asks, gets refused, then Jagoda asks from different angle. This is mild manipulation, strategic rather than purely sycophantic. Carter recognizes it: "he knew he was being played with here." Shows staff coordinating to influence principal's decisions.

### 8. Carter Recognizing Staff Manipulation
> "Occasionally Carter—of course, he knew he was being played with here—would say, 'I've already said 'No' to that, but since you are making such a big issue of it….'" (p.5)

**Codes**: principal-sees-through-tactics, acknowledging-manipulation, carter-tolerance
**Memo**: Carter aware of the "two chances" tactic but tolerated it. Shows sophisticated principal who understands staff will try to persuade him. His acknowledgment actually reduces pure sycophancy - he's not being fooled, and staff know he knows. Creates more honest dynamic.

### 9. Carter as Extremely Demanding Boss
> "By far the biggest pressure was concern about trying to be responsive to the President. The thing gets quickly elevated. First of all, Carter by nature—having been a military guy and having been a governor—is used to people jumping. He seems like a nice guy but: 'Goddamn it, I asked you about this yesterday! Where's the answer?' He was a very strict disciplinarian and was a very, very tough boss." (p.18)

**Codes**: demanding-boss, military-background, expecting-responsiveness, strict-disciplinarian
**Memo**: Carter's military and gubernatorial background created expectations of immediate compliance - "used to people jumping." This creates environment where sycophancy would flourish - staff must be highly responsive to avoid angry outbursts. Antecedent: military/executive experience. Consequence: staff pressure to be "on your toes" constantly.

### 10. Scheduling and Time as Carter's Irritation Points
> "A lot of times, 'I've already told you people, I don't want to do it that way!' In other words there would be something he'd said, and word didn't get around. Scheduling and time were the biggest areas of irritation for Carter. He, of course, was very concerned about being over-scheduled because he didn't want to be late." (p.19)

**Codes**: presidential-irritation, communication-failures, scheduling-control, repetition-anger
**Memo**: Carter's anger when staff didn't follow previous instructions creates pressure for hyper-attentiveness to his preferences. "I've already told you people" - staff must remember and comply with all directives. Perfectionism about scheduling reinforces need for staff to anticipate and prevent problems.

### 11. "Too Much Ink" Problem
> "In my case, there was just a little bit of concern about—I did get quoted a lot. I was available and particularly on small things like staffing or offices or what people were doing, the style questions, I didn't have any fear about saying what I thought. From time to time Carter might say something about, 'I see you're being a good source again,' or something like that... 'I'm the President. Why are you mouthing off?'" (p.19)

**Codes**: staff-visibility-problem, too-much-ink, presidential-primacy, colleague-resentment
**Memo**: Jagoda's visibility in press created tension - Carter: "I'm the President. Why are you mouthing off?" Staff shouldn't outshine principal. Classic sycophancy boundary - serve invisibly. Jagoda's journalism background made him comfortable with press, but this violated norm of staff invisibility. Created problems with both Carter and colleagues "who thought I got too much ink."

### 12. Loyalty to Powell and Carter as Protection
> "Actually that was not ever a problem. I had a consistent attitude toward one thing from the first day that I met Carter and that was that I was working for Powell as much as for Carter. Those two guys pretty much—as long as you were square with them you didn't have any problems, at least in my situation." (p.19)

**Codes**: dual-loyalty, being-square, protective-relationships, powell-buffer
**Memo**: Jagoda's explicit loyalty to both Powell and Carter protected him from "too much ink" problem becoming serious. "As long as you were square with them you didn't have any problems" - honesty and loyalty as protective factors. This is functional rather than sycophantic loyalty - based on trust and honesty, not flattery.

### 13. Hamilton Jordan as Directive Boss
> "Personnel issues like: on the Endowment for the Humanities, and National Public Radio. Things like that, that I had gotten delegated to. He was very much interested in those. He would call— [MK: Did he call looking for names or clearing people with you?] Mainly, he would call when he 'wanted the following…' done... He wanted to be sure that so-and-so was interviewed and seen. He would call giving direction." (p.19)

**Codes**: jordan-directive-style, personnel-control, political-appointments, top-down-direction
**Memo**: Jordan's approach to personnel = giving orders, not consulting. "He would call when he wanted the following done." This is hierarchical, expecting compliance. Jagoda notes Jordan was "very efficient and didn't waste a lot of time" - praise for someone who gives clear direction and expects execution. Contrast with more consultative approaches.

### 14. Long Hours Culture and Self-Importance Balance
> "I would set my alarm at six and I'd be in the office six-forty. I tried to be in by seven. I used to watch the evening news in my office. So that would be from seven to seven-thirty. I was a bachelor for that whole period of time. I didn't have a family. I was pretty much on my own. I ate out a lot. So I was working there, not as long as David Rubenstein, but not too far away. Everyone worked long hours. Everyone. It would be strange if you called somebody's office at seven or seven-thirty and they weren't there. It would be very strange." (p.21-22)

**Codes**: long-hours-culture, work-intensity, everyone-working-late, bachelor-advantage
**Memo**: Universal expectation of 12-14 hour days, 7am-7:30pm or later. "Everyone worked long hours. Everyone. It would be strange if you called somebody's office at seven or seven-thirty and they weren't there." This is organizational sycophancy - demonstrating commitment through presence and availability. Jagoda's bachelor status enabled this. Rubenstein mentioned as extreme example.

### 15. Balancing Importance and Self-Importance
> "I definitely remember thinking, 'I may as well do this now, and put in these long hours and give it my all; when else would I do it, if I'm not going to do it now?' There's that sense of: 'This is really important.' That's good, I think, because it is important. The other side of it is you don't want to be too self-important. That's really a delicate balance." (p.22)

**Codes**: work-intensity-justification, importance-vs-self-importance, sacrificing-for-role
**Memo**: Jagoda reflects on psychological dynamic - believing the work is important (justifies sacrifice) but not becoming self-important (recognizing you're serving, not starring). This is healthy anti-sycophancy - taking work seriously without inflating own importance. The "delicate balance" he describes is key to avoiding both disengagement and egotism.

### 16. Third Year Shift to Hardball Politics
> "So it was, on the one hand: 'What can we show that we're doing right?', and, on the other hand, 'Let's be nice to our friends, and ignore our enemies, penalize our enemies.' It got a little hardball, I guess you would say. I wasn't much help in this. I thought that, basically inflation was up, and there were a lot of problems, there were subsequent problems; he was a good victim and there wasn't much that could be done. That is not a very helpful attitude to have in a situation where people were an extremely competitive group of people who wanted to win. I personally wasn't very helpful, but I could see all around me there were people putting on shoulder pads and getting ready to get rough." (p.15)

**Codes**: third-year-shift, hardball-politics, competitive-intensity, penalize-enemies, reelection-pressure
**Memo**: When polls dropped in third year, shift from openness to "hardball" - "be nice to our friends, and ignore our enemies, penalize our enemies." Staff "putting on shoulder pads and getting ready to get rough." Jagoda couldn't match this competitive intensity, admitted "I wasn't much help." Antecedent: reelection pressure, falling approval ratings. Consequence: more aggressive, win-focused approach. Suggests sycophancy may increase under political threat.

### 17. Jody Powell's Shift to Nasty Approach
> "It was also in this period that Jody started to change his attitude toward the press: 'I'm going to be nasty; I'm going to be mad; I'm going to be angry; that's how you get respect in this town.' It was sort of: 'We've been too easy and too friendly….'" (p.15)

**Codes**: powell-attitude-shift, too-friendly-problem, getting-tough, respect-through-anger
**Memo**: Powell's strategic decision to be "nasty," "mad," "angry" with press - "that's how you get respect in this town." Belief that previous openness/friendliness was weakness. This is anti-sycophantic toward press (refusing to court them) but may reflect sycophancy to political calculation (doing what "works" rather than what's authentic). Shows shift from Carter's authentic openness to more manipulative approach.

### 18. Cabinet Firings and Personnel Shuffle
> "The one problem was, about halfway through the Carter Administration, there was this bloodletting where Carter fired [Joseph] Califano and three or four members of the Cabinet... Later on, I think everyone was so busy, the bureaucracy took charge. That was a theme of the whole Carter period, which was: 'The government took over.' Instead of the elected officials running the government, the government was running the elected officials." (p.14)

**Codes**: cabinet-bloodletting, bureaucracy-taking-over, government-running-officials, loss-of-control
**Memo**: Mid-administration purge of cabinet members, followed by sense that "the government was running the elected officials" rather than vice versa. This is failure of sycophancy in sense that bureaucracy wouldn't bend to president's will. Jagoda puzzled: "I don't quite know how that happened; it seems incomprehensible to me." Suggests Carter's management approach failed to establish necessary control.

### 19. Carter's "Spartan Approach" and Delegation Problems
> "It may have been just that, through Carter's spartan approach to things, he just assumed that things would just roll on—we'd get very irritated with him when there were troubles like this. There was a competent fellow named Rick Hutcheson who was the Cabinet Secretary—he was Staff Secretary—who would be responsible for getting these papers. Sometimes they wouldn't come in. There would be a lot of irritation there." (p.14)

**Codes**: spartan-approach, delegation-failure, paper-flow-problems, staff-irritation
**Memo**: Carter's "spartan approach" = assuming things would work without close supervision. Staff "very irritated with him" when papers didn't come in. This is anti-micro-management but created dysfunction. Shows Carter's style didn't inspire sufficient compliance from bureaucracy. Lack of oversight enabled others not to comply - insufficient sycophancy from departments to president.

### 20. Adversarial View of Press vs. Jagoda's Idealism
> "In an adversarial way, an adversarial manner; as people out trying to cause trouble and get them. I will give Carter credit for realizing that this function had to go on and that there was a certain gamesmanship involved. He didn't mind the questions, because he needed to have the answers to those questions. They were legitimate questions he needed to have the answers to. But, generally, the staff members didn't see it that way." (p.12)

**Codes**: adversarial-press-view, press-as-enemy, carter-accepting-questions, staff-vs-president-view
**Memo**: Staff viewed press "in an adversarial manner; as people out trying to cause trouble and get them." Carter more sophisticated - saw questions as legitimate even if uncomfortable. Jagoda held idealistic view of press as "dispassionate, detached representatives of the public" - which "I would get at best a smile" from colleagues. Shows different philosophies of press relations - sycophantic to political calculation (see press as enemy) vs. democratic ideal (see press as public surrogate).

### 21. Re-election Bringing Hierarchical Structure
> "Actually, part of the reason that this situation changed with Carter was that things were somewhat in disarray, and there was concern about getting re-elected. Concern about being re-elected, I think, is what brought Hamilton Jordan back in, to try and run the place: 'We got elected once; I ran that; I may as well come back and be the Chief of Staff and run the reelection.'" (p.14)

**Codes**: reelection-pressure, jordan-as-chief, hierarchy-creation, campaign-manager-return
**Memo**: Disarray and reelection concerns led to creation of chief of staff position with Jordan. "We got elected once; I ran that" - campaign success gives Jordan authority to demand compliance. Shows how political pressure creates more hierarchical (sycophancy-enabling) structures. Initial "no chief of staff" ideal abandoned under performance pressure.

### 22. Phone Call Importance Asymmetry
> "Second, and the thing that struck me the most, was that every phone conversation I had was terribly important to the person on the other end of the line. They were calling the White House; they were getting some White House official; they really cared. It was just another phone call as far as I was concerned. I have somewhere—the administrator in our office kept very, very good logs. I remember being amazed, looking later, at the people who had called, senators and college presidents and heads of companies." (p.18)

**Codes**: asymmetric-importance, white-house-mystique, routine-vs-significant, call-logs
**Memo**: Dynamic where every call is critically important to external person but routine to White House staffer. "They really cared. It was just another phone call as far as I was concerned." This creates temptation for abuse - people seeking favor from someone who doesn't need them. Jagoda's reflection: "I had to keep reminding myself that I had a lot of responsibility" - recognition that power asymmetry requires ethical awareness.

### 23. Limited Impact Realization
> "I suppose that I would have liked to have had a better tempering of my idealism with some longer view. I got involved in this thing in the first place because I didn't like Nixon; I thought Carter was a good antidote. That's part of the reason a lot of people voted for Carter. But I guess if I had— what I would have liked to have known, I would have from a personal standpoint liked to have had some deeper, broader sense of what I wanted to do with my life, so that this experience could have been useful for the long term." (p.16)

**Codes**: idealism-vs-realism, limited-policy-impact, anti-nixon-motivation, disillusionment
**Memo**: Jagoda reflects on entering with idealism (anti-Nixon motivation) but realizing limited actual impact. "I don't think that's the case, in retrospect. I think it's very hard to move the government." This is mature recognition that individual staff members, even in White House, have limited influence. Anti-sycophancy insight - the powerful position doesn't actually give you that much power.

### 24. Breadth vs. Depth Problem
> "I was merely a journalist, which meant that I was interested in a lot of things, but did not know much about anything in depth. So it would have been helpful to have a Ph.D. in something, or to know something in some depth, or to have worked somewhere besides in journalism. I think I would have been a more valuable person around there and it would have been a more useful experience." (p.16)

**Codes**: breadth-vs-depth, journalist-background, expertise-deficit, policy-substance-need
**Memo**: Jagoda's self-criticism - journalism background gave him media expertise but not deep policy knowledge. This connects to sycophancy because expertise is protective factor - people with deep knowledge can push back on bad ideas. Generalists more likely to defer to principals' preferences. He recognized this limitation too late.

### 25. Most Interesting Work Ever
> "The disadvantage is that, even though I consider my own personal experience there less than satisfying, and I consider the Carter Administration less than satisfying—even though that's the case, it was by far the most interesting work I've ever had and I'm sure it will be the most interesting work I ever do have. That's a positive and a negative." (p.24)

**Codes**: peak-experience, satisfaction-vs-interest, nothing-compares, career-baseline
**Memo**: White House as career peak - "by far the most interesting work I've ever had and I'm sure it will be the most interesting work I ever do have." Creates problem for later life - everything else disappointing by comparison. This is consequence of intense White House experience. Also shows why people are willing to work such long hours and accept demanding conditions - the experience itself is reward.

### 26. Public Service with Little Personal Benefit
> "It's a lot of hard work, terribly long hours, and there's really not that much in it for the individual. You really are a public servant. Honest to god, in some ways the only way in which it is a good career move, excuse the impression, is that it's on your resume so people are always asking me [inaudible] as though that meant something. It does add something to the resume." (p.24-25)

**Codes**: public-service-ideal, limited-personal-benefit, resume-value, sacrifice
**Memo**: Jagoda reflects that White House service offers little personal benefit beyond resume value. "You really are a public servant" - suggesting genuine service over self-interest. This is anti-sycophantic in that he didn't use position for personal gain. But also shows why sycophancy might develop - if serving principal is the main way to succeed, then staff have incentive to please rather than challenge.

### 27. Inability to Step Back and Reflect
> "I think there was an amazing amount of daily activity and a long list of things that had to be done that day. You could never sit back and think things through. I so wish that I'd had a chance to think things through in a more in-depth way. That's the way it is in life... I believe it's impossible. I think there's just no time for that. The idea of stepping back, you just can't do that." (p.24)

**Codes**: no-time-to-think, constant-action, lack-of-reflection, impossible-to-step-back
**Memo**: Relentless pace prevents strategic thinking - "You could never sit back and think things through." This creates environment where sycophancy can flourish - no time to evaluate whether you're doing right thing, just reacting to demands. "The President is going; he's moving; you have to keep going; you can't stop." Thoughtful resistance requires time to think; constant action prevents it.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Anti-Sycophantic Ideals vs. Political Realities**: Jagoda's rejection of image-making and belief in Carter's authenticity vs. third-year shift to "hardball" politics

2. **Watson-Jordan Power Struggle**: Classic loyalty vs. expertise conflict - campaign manager feeling threatened by competent transition director

3. **Carter as Demanding Boss**: Military/gubernatorial background creating expectation of immediate compliance, staff "jumping" on command

4. **Organizational Structure Symbolism**: Rejection of chief of staff initially for anti-Haldeman symbolism, later necessity of hierarchy for functionality

5. **Long Hours as Commitment Display**: Universal expectation of 14+ hour days as demonstration of dedication

6. **Staff Visibility Problem**: "Too much ink" issue - staff must serve invisibly, not outshine principal

7. **Powell-Jagoda "Two Chances" System**: Strategic persuasion tactics showing staff coordination to influence decisions

8. **Third-Year Transformation**: Falling polls creating shift to competitive, aggressive, enemy-penalizing approach

9. **Press Relations Philosophy**: Tension between adversarial view (staff) vs. democratic ideal (Jagoda) vs. pragmatic acceptance (Carter)

10. **Limited Time for Reflection**: Relentless pace preventing strategic thinking, creating reactive compliance culture

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Carter's military and gubernatorial background expecting immediate compliance
- Lack of chief of staff initially creating organizational confusion
- Campaign vs. transition personnel conflicts
- Reelection pressure in third year
- Long hours culture normalizing sacrifice
- Power asymmetries in phone calls and access

**Manifestations**:
- "People jumping" when Carter demands action
- Long hours (7am-7:30pm+) as commitment display
- Hamilton Jordan giving directive orders expecting compliance
- Staff coordinating to work around Carter's refusals
- Shift to "hardball" approach with enemies
- Staff visibility kept low ("too much ink" problem)

**Consequences**:
- Organizational dysfunction from avoiding hierarchy
- Watson-Jordan feud creating transition chaos
- Later necessity of creating chief of staff position
- Staff unable to step back and think strategically
- Bureaucracy taking over despite presidential authority
- Experience so intense nothing else compares afterward

**Protective Factors**:
- Jagoda's journalism background and professional norms
- Philosophy rejecting image manipulation
- Carter's sophistication (seeing through "two chances" tactic)
- Explicit loyalty based on honesty ("being square")
- Carter's acceptance of legitimate questions
- Jagoda's idealistic view of democratic institutions
