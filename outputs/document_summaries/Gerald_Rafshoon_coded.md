# Jimmy Carter Transition - Gerald Rafshoon Interview
**Date**: December 29, 1999
**Interviewee**: Gerald Rafshoon (Director of Communications, 1978-1981)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Rafshoon discusses his role as Carter's Communications Director, coming in midstream after initial organizational problems. Key themes include the mistake of cabinet government (letting cabinet pick own people), the value of the "Georgia mafia" who weren't "turf conscious" and could speak frankly to Carter, tensions with Washington insiders who wouldn't disagree with the president, and the challenge of maintaining objectivity once inside the White House. Provides insights on the importance of loyalty combined with frankness, the dangers of accommodating too many voices, and how "telling the truth is a good strategy."

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Cabinet Government Mistake - Loyalty vs. Competence
> "I think one of the mistakes we made was we approached the idea of cabinet government very idealistically and we let the cabinet people pick their own people. That was a mistake. They were picking people in many respects who had been [Ted] Kennedy people and [Mo] Udall people and some [Henry] Jackson people: their people. The truth of the matter is we should have had some of our own people in every cabinet department, especially in the communications area, because we were not speaking with one voice. There were times we would have a certain take on an issue in the White House, and we'd have cabinet members saying an entirely different thing. We weren't able to control it entirely, as well as we needed to." (p.3)

**Codes**: cabinet-government-mistake, loyalty-vs-competence, letting-cabinet-pick-people, speaking-with-one-voice-failure, kennedy-udall-people
**Memo**: Critical mistake allowing cabinet secretaries to hire their own people - they hired supporters of other candidates (Kennedy, Udall, Jackson) rather than Carter loyalists. Consequence: couldn't speak with "one voice," different takes on issues. This is failure of sycophancy in sense that cabinet people weren't loyal to Carter's vision. Antecedent: idealistic approach to cabinet government. Protective factor would have been: placing own people in every department, especially communications.

### 2. Democrats on Hill Undermining Carter
> "We found that, on the Hill, the majority of the stories that were hurting us were coming from Democrats on the Hill. They just had their own agenda. They weren't being malicious but Carter was a guy who came here—they didn't know him; he didn't have a lot of friends; he didn't come with their permission and they didn't want him to stay particularly. And a lot of them said, up there were people who said, 'Why not me? This guy from Georgia is the President.' The same attitude we had when we saw presidential candidates come to Georgia in 1972: 'If these guys can do it, we can do it.'" (p.2)

**Codes**: democrats-undermining-carter, came-without-permission, why-not-me, no-deference-to-outsider, hill-vs-president
**Memo**: Democratic members of Congress actively undermining Carter through press - "majority of the stories that were hurting us were coming from Democrats on the Hill." Not malicious but pursuing own agendas. They resented that he "didn't come with their permission" and thought "Why not me?" This is anti-sycophancy - refusal to defer to president from own party because he's outsider. Antecedent: Carter as outsider without Hill relationships. Consequence: constant negative stories from supposed allies.

### 3. Califano: Not a Team Player
> "Joe Califano who is a friend of mine now, but Joe Califano— [MK: Was not a team player.] —was not a team player at all. When he finally had to go, you read about how he disagreed with Carter. He never did that in the meeting; he never did that in public. I could say, 'You are full of shit, Mr. President.' Those people never did." (p.8)

**Codes**: califano-not-team-player, disagrees-privately-complies-publicly, false-deference, washington-insiders-wont-disagree
**Memo**: Califano exemplifies false sycophancy - appeared compliant in meetings, never disagreed publicly, but undermined behind scenes and complained after being fired. Contrast with Rafshoon: "I could say, 'You are full of shit, Mr. President.'" Washington insiders showed surface deference but not genuine loyalty. Georgia people showed genuine respect through honest disagreement. This is key distinction: real anti-sycophancy (frank disagreement) vs. false compliance (sycophantic surface with hidden resistance).

###4. Califano Undermining on Tobacco and Department of Education
> "The tobacco, the Department of Education. We had Congressmen calling up Frank Moore saying, 'Wait a minute. You guys are for the Department of Education, or against it? How do you want me to go?' We said, 'It's our thing!' They said, 'Well, Califano was up here saying to vote against it.'... Califano came in almost crying when he—. 'I'm stunned. I've been fired.' 'Joey, I don't know why you're so stunned. You've been fucking him for three years.'" (p.8)

**Codes**: califano-undermining, speaking-with-different-voice, false-surprise-at-firing, edward-bennett-williams-quote
**Memo**: Specific example of Califano's disloyalty - lobbying Congress to vote against Carter's Department of Education initiative. Created confusion: "You guys are for the Department of Education, or against it?" Edward Bennett Williams's response when Califano claimed to be "stunned" at firing: "Joey, I don't know why you're so stunned. You've been fucking him for three years." This is active sabotage disguised as loyal service. Consequence: policy confusion, congressional defeats.

### 5. Georgia Mafia Frankness and Lack of Turf Consciousness
> "Those four people there [gesturing at group photo] were not turf conscious. We had been together so long. Caddell was a Johnny-come-lately, but he fit in very well in the campaign. I go back to when that farmer from South Georgia came to my office and wanted to run for governor; he was a state senator. Hamilton was the youth coordinator. Jody, three years later, came on as his driver. But the point is: we didn't worry about how we stood with Jimmy. We could talk frankly to him, and we could talk frankly to each other, and he would not have tolerated any kind of bickering, any kind of turf battle. We bickered; we fought among ourselves, but we didn't worry that the loser of an argument is going to be out." (p.7)

**Codes**: not-turf-conscious, long-relationship, could-talk-frankly, no-worry-about-standing, carter-wouldnt-tolerate-bickering, loser-not-out
**Memo**: Core protective factor against sycophancy - the four (Jordan, Powell, Caddell, Rafshoon) "didn't worry about how we stood with Jimmy." Could disagree frankly without fear of being fired. "Loser of an argument is going to be out" - didn't have to worry about this. Antecedent: long shared history, Carter's intolerance of turf battles. This created honest rather than sycophantic dynamic. Consequence: better advice, genuine debate.

### 6. Carter's Challenge: "You Think It's Easy, Don't You?"
> "Within a year, things started going a little south, ratings in the polls and some of the things we saw weren't happening in the White House, that the selling apparatus wasn't functioning properly. I would start complaining and I was writing memos to the President and Hamilton and people that would listen to me about what they needed to do. Finally, the President said—I was bitching about something and he said, 'You think it's easy, don't you?' He said, 'You come in here and then talk about things we ought to do and go off'—as he said—'on some Caribbean hideaway with some cutie'—which wasn't true—'and come back and complain. Why don't you try coming in here and see what it's like, see what you can get done?'" (p.7)

**Codes**: carter-challenges-rafshoon, easy-to-criticize-from-outside, come-try-it-yourself, consultant-vs-staffer
**Memo**: Carter's frustration with Rafshoon's outside criticism - "You think it's easy, don't you?" Challenges him to come inside and try. This is leader pushing back against advice that seems disconnected from reality of constraints. Shows Carter wasn't passively accepting criticism. Consequence: Rafshoon came inside, but then "lost a little bit of my detachment and my objectivity."

### 7. Loss of Objectivity When Inside
> "I got involved in everything but I had things I didn't do. I didn't have to supervise people on the outside. I didn't have line responsibilities. But when I came in, I knew more of what was going on, and I was better informed, so I could make judgments. On the other hand, I lost a little bit of my detachment and my objectivity. I started feeling the hunkering down at times. I also found myself a little more hesitant to bother the President, since I was seeing him on a day-to-day basis and saw all the problems he had, and I kind of bought into –'this is tough, let's pull back some.'" (p.8)

**Codes**: loss-of-detachment, loss-of-objectivity, hunkering-down, hesitant-to-bother-president, bought-into-toughness
**Memo**: Critical reflection on how being inside changed Rafshoon's ability to give honest advice. "Lost a little bit of my detachment and my objectivity." Started "feeling the hunkering down" and became "hesitant to bother the President." This is how sycophancy develops - not from desire to flatter, but from empathy and seeing constraints. "I kind of bought into - 'this is tough, let's pull back some.'" Shows how proximity can reduce critical thinking.

### 8. Understanding Carter's Moods - Strategic Approach
> "But the thing that those four people [in the group picture at Camp David] were able to do, we could always—we understood Jimmy; we knew his moods. We knew when he was right and when he was wrong, or at least we knew – when he would say something – we'd say, 'Let's not frontally oppose it but let's sit around and strategize how to get it changed.'" (p.8)

**Codes**: understanding-moods, knowing-when-right-when-wrong, not-frontally-opposing, strategizing-to-change
**Memo**: Sophisticated approach to influencing principal - "Let's not frontally oppose it but let's sit around and strategize how to get it changed." This is strategic influence rather than either sycophancy (automatic agreement) or confrontation (frontal opposition). Shows political intelligence in managing upward. The ability to do this came from long relationship and understanding of "his moods."

### 9. Washington Insiders Never Disagreed
> "There was always talk about the fact that Carter needed more Washington insiders. The truth of the matter is, the ones that we did have around us never disagreed with the President and never argued with him. They would come to us if they had—." (p.8)

**Codes**: washington-insiders-never-disagreed, never-argued, came-to-georgia-people-if-disagreed
**Memo**: Washington insiders showed more sycophantic behavior than outsiders. "Never disagreed with the President and never argued with him." If they had concerns, "they would come to us" - the Georgia people. This inverts conventional wisdom that insiders know how to speak truth to power. Actually, insiders were more deferential, perhaps because they understood consequences or were more career-focused. Georgia people, with less to lose and longer relationships, could be frank.

### 10. Hesitation to Confront When Seeing Burden
> "But I can also remember, though, there were times when you'd open the door to the study to talk to him about something, the Iranian crisis: 'I'm going in, I'm going to have it out with Jimmy because this has got to stop; this is wrong—and he'd look up and you'd see the kind of burden this whole stuff, 'Yes, what is it?' 'Nothing, Mr. President.'" Maybe if I'd still been on the outside I'd have known less and been able to say more." (p.8-9)

**Codes**: seeing-burden, hesitation-to-confront, nothing-mr-president, outside-knew-less-said-more
**Memo**: Powerful moment showing how empathy creates sycophancy. Rafshoon ready to "have it out with Jimmy" but seeing Carter's burden: "you'd see the kind of burden this whole stuff, 'Yes, what is it?' 'Nothing, Mr. President.'" Recognition: "Maybe if I'd still been on the outside I'd have known less and been able to say more." This is tragedy of proximity - closeness creates understanding which creates sympathy which creates hesitation to add to burden. Well-intentioned but reduces critical input.

### 11. Rafshoon: "Wrong Person for Job"
> "The point is, even when I came in, we used to talk about long-range communications and long-range was [next week]. Next week is long-range in the White House, because every time I would say: 'I'm going to stay in my office today and just write a communications plan for SALT [Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty]…,' or Middle East peace, and all that stuff something would happen. You can't just close your ears to it. I think I was probably the wrong person for that job, because I was too close to the President, so that I could not stay out of things that should have been done by his personal political [staff]." (p.4)

**Codes**: wrong-person-for-job, too-close-to-president, couldnt-stay-out, long-range-means-next-week
**Memo**: Rafshoon's self-criticism - "too close to the President" to do communications job effectively. Got pulled into everything (Bert Lance, political damage control) rather than focusing on strategic communications. This is problem of loyalty trumping functional effectiveness. Someone with less personal loyalty might have maintained better boundaries. Shows tension between personal relationship and professional role.

### 12. Powell "Too Close to the President"
> "I think also— have you talked to Jody? [MK: I haven't talked to him on this one yet.] Jody was a great press secretary. [MK: I've talked to him many times.] Having said that, I think—Jody says—whenever they talk about him being one of the great press secretaries of all time or in recent years—he says with the president who came out with 20 per cent approval rating: 'He must have been really good!' But the problem there was: he was too close to the President. I don't think the spokesman should be in a substantive role. He should be kept informed. I think the Clintons got it right. Mike McCurry was not that close to the President." (p.5)

**Codes**: powell-too-close, spokesman-not-substantive-role, mccurry-distance, credibility-vs-closeness
**Memo**: Rafshoon argues Powell's closeness was both strength and weakness. "Too close to the President" - couldn't "recuse himself on anything" because Carter relied on him for everything. Contrast with McCurry model - deliberately kept at distance to maintain credibility and focus on communication rather than policy-making. "I don't think the spokesman should be in a substantive role." This is structural argument about sycophancy - closeness creates conflicts between advocacy and communication.

### 13. Jody Was Carter's Driver - Deep Service Relationship
> "Remember, Jody was his driver at one time." (p.5)

**Codes**: jody-was-driver, deep-service-history, subordinate-origins
**Memo**: Single line revealing depth of Powell-Carter relationship origins. Started as driver - deeply subordinate role. This history of personal service may have created dynamic where Powell saw himself as serving Carter in all capacities. Contrast with Rafshoon who met Carter as established businessman. Different entry points create different relationships - service-based vs. peer-based.

### 14. Need Loyal People, Not Washington Insiders
> "I think you have to have people who are loyal and have really good political instincts, and can do tasks, too; write or analyze or do speeches or can lead other people to do it. But I think you need a hard core of staffers. And I would urge subsequent presidencies not to be swayed by the complaints from, say, the Washington insiders that you have a bunch of people who have never been here before, never done it before. All presidencies in modern times, every one of them, have been won by first-timers, by amateurs and people who are smart enough to look at the past and know what has to be done but also innovate, adapt to whatever the rules, the current zeitgeist is." (p.7)

**Codes**: need-loyal-people, good-political-instincts, hard-core-staffers, resist-washington-insider-pressure, first-timers-win, innovate-and-adapt
**Memo**: Rafshoon's prescription: loyalty + political instincts + competence. "Need a hard core of staffers" who are loyal. Warns against letting "Washington insiders" pressure you to hire experienced people. "All presidencies in modern times...have been won by first-timers, by amateurs." This valorizes loyalty and fresh thinking over experience. Suggests sycophancy less likely with people who "innovate, adapt" rather than follow established patterns.

### 15. Clinton People Didn't Want Carter Advice
> "It's bouncing things off—what always surprised me was when the Clinton people came in, we tried to help: Hamilton and I and Jody - give some advice to them. Of course, they didn't want to be associated with our sort of government and all that. The truth of the matter is: the advice we were giving was based on our mistakes, not 'look how great we were.' It was, 'Look. Look how we fucked up here.'" (p.11)

**Codes**: clinton-rejected-advice, didnt-want-association, advice-based-on-mistakes, arrogance-of-new-administration
**Memo**: New administrations' refusal to learn from predecessors - Clinton people "didn't want to be associated with our sort of government." This is arrogance creating avoidable mistakes. Rafshoon emphasizing they were offering lessons from failures, not bragging. This connects to Arnie Miller's theme of "arrogance, ignorance, and adrenaline" - each new administration thinks they're different/smarter. Consequence: repeat mistakes.

### 16. "Telling the Truth is a Good Strategy"
> "When we followed our original political instincts, we usually did well: they were Jimmy's political instincts. When we tried to accommodate other views—. [MK: Why do you think that is?] Because, in the long run, telling the truth is a good strategy. Believing in something and being true to it is a better strategy than the other way." (p.15)

**Codes**: truth-as-strategy, following-political-instincts, accommodating-others-fails, authenticity-works
**Memo**: Rafshoon's key insight: "telling the truth is a good strategy. Believing in something and being true to it is a better strategy than the other way." When Carter followed his own instincts (like vetoing nuclear carrier), it worked. When they "tried to accommodate other views," it failed. This is anti-sycophancy principle - authenticity and principle work better than strategic positioning. But requires confidence and willingness to take hits.

### 17. State of the Union: Constant Fight Against Laundry Lists
> "We'd always constantly strive to make them thematic and inspirational and visionary - as opposed to programmatic, political, and boring. It was a constant fight with special interests—I'm not even going to say special interests—our departments to keep out laundry lists of things. I, in meetings with others, would try to shape what the theme would be. I kind of look at it like an advertising program. What is the slogan? I'm not saying a slogan. But what is the theme we're trying to get through, whether it was the economy—let's not have anything here that's not one of the three E's, economy, efficiency and energy; I don't want to talk about anything else." (p.16)

**Codes**: thematic-vs-laundry-list, constant-fight-with-departments, everyone-wants-piece, keeping-message-focused
**Memo**: Rafshoon describes battle to maintain message discipline. "Constant fight with...our departments to keep out laundry lists." Everyone demanding their issue be included. This is form of organizational sycophancy - departments wanting presidential validation. Rafshoon trying to resist: "I don't want to talk about anything else." Shows how diffuse demands create message confusion.

### 18. Labor Demanding Mention in State of Union
> "I remember our labor coordinator coming up and saying he had just talked to [labor leader] Lane Kirkland and Lane Kirkland said that George Meany, who had died the year before, on his deathbed said: '…to please have the President mention labor law reform in the State of the Union address.' I said, 'Are you kidding me?' He said, 'That's what he said; if we don't have it in there, we're in deep shit with labor.' And then Carter would come back and say, 'Strong defense; put in strong defense and better schools.' You'd fight and fight to keep that out." (p.16)

**Codes**: deathbed-request, deep-shit-with-labor, carter-adding-back, fight-to-keep-out
**Memo**: Hilarious but revealing example of pressure to include items. Labor using Meany's "deathbed" request for leverage - "if we don't have it in there, we're in deep shit with labor." Then Carter himself adding things back: "Strong defense; put in strong defense and better schools." Everyone wants their issue validated by presidential mention. Rafshoon: "You'd fight and fight to keep that out." This is staff protecting president from his own desire to please constituencies.

### 19. Reagan and Clinton: "Didn't Care What Those Idiots Out There Wanted"
> "I should have been firmer; the President should have been firmer. The Reagan people knew how to do it. They didn't really care what those idiots out there wanted; it was what's best for the president. Therefore, he always came out—and Clinton, too, with being thematic, being inspirational. Clinton's amazing. He's wonderful. He's the best actor that's ever been in the White House." (p.16)

**Codes**: should-have-been-firmer, reagan-didnt-care-what-idiots-wanted, whats-best-for-president, clinton-best-actor
**Memo**: Rafshoon's regret: "I should have been firmer; the President should have been firmer." Admiration for Reagan approach: "didn't really care what those idiots out there wanted; it was what's best for the president." This is interesting - calling it "anti-sycophancy" but it's actually refusing to be sycophantic to constituencies/departments, being "sycophantic" only to strategic message discipline. Reagan prioritized presidential interests over departmental/interest group demands. Carter too accommodating. Clinton learned this lesson.

### 20. Polling Never Used to Make Policy Decisions
> "We only polled about quarterly, and it was never used to make a decision on what to do. It was used to see how effectively what we were doing was working, and it was used for message development; but you couldn't go to Carter and say, 'The majority of the people don't like us giving back the Panama Canal,' and expect him to change policy. So it was useful in message development and for just taking a reading on how we were doing is perceived. It was after-the-fact." (p.21)

**Codes**: polling-quarterly, not-for-policy-decisions, for-message-development, after-the-fact, carter-wouldnt-change-policy
**Memo**: Important distinction - polls used for communications strategy, not policy. "You couldn't go to Carter and say, 'The majority of the people don't like us giving back the Panama Canal,' and expect him to change policy." This is anti-sycophancy to public opinion. Carter would do what he thought right regardless of polls. Contrast with Clinton who used polls much more extensively. But Rafshoon defends this: did right thing even when unpopular.

### 21. Reward: Seeing Carter "Doing the Right Thing"
> "In my case, the reward that I felt was truthfully seeing my friend, Jimmy Carter, doing the right thing and being a part of it. By and large he did the right thing. [Inaudible] Camp David accords, Middle East peace, going to summits, fighting for things like nuclear arms control and changing the way people use energy; reforming, fighting special interests as much as we could. We didn't do enough of it. It was better than making ads for Sears-Roebuck. I'd leave a meeting at the White House and I always felt that was a privilege to work there and being around him, being around somebody who, no matter what you think of the Carter presidency—we really didn't succeed the way we'd have liked to—I think it was better than the rendered judgment lately. But to know that you're involved in things that are bigger than yourself is very gratifying." (p.19)

**Codes**: reward-seeing-friend-do-right-thing, privilege-to-work-there, bigger-than-yourself, defending-carter-presidency
**Memo**: Rafshoon's motivation = loyalty to friend + belief in rightness of cause. "Seeing my friend, Jimmy Carter, doing the right thing and being a part of it." This is basis for non-sycophantic loyalty - belief that principal is doing right thing. "I always felt that was a privilege to work there and being around him." This is admiration without blind obedience. Key phrase: "By and large he did the right thing" - "by and large" shows critical perspective, not worshipful.

### 22. Losing Election Makes You a Pariah
> "Absolutely. It's just a strange phenomenon. If you lose an election, then your term has been judged a failure by people in the press. If you lose big, a gigantic failure. It's just now people are recognizing the accomplishments of the Carter administration but coming off of it it was like you're a pariah that nobody wants to be around. Carter was a pariah. And yet we kept the peace and we had an honest administration. We brought peace in the Middle East, the only one that's endured, taking Egypt out of the equation, so you don't have major conflagration in the Middle East." (p.19)

**Codes**: losing-makes-you-pariah, nobody-wants-around, accomplishments-not-recognized, kept-peace-honest-administration
**Memo**: Consequence of electoral defeat for staff - "you're a pariah that nobody wants to be around." Despite substantive accomplishments (peace, honesty, Middle East peace), loss delegitimizes everything. This creates strong incentive for sycophancy - staff desperate to help president win reelection to validate their service and maintain relevance. Rafshoon defending Carter legacy even 20 years later.

### 23. "You Lose Any Sense of Awe"
> "The relationships I have, the greatest relationships—those guys in the picture—those will go on forever. You learn to deal with all types of people. You also lose any sense of awe. You meet every head of state, you meet the great, the near great, the not so great as you thought. So you tend to get a seasoning that allows you to go into any situation. You learn, especially if you worked in the press and communications area, to be skeptical; you learn that what you see is not always what you get. So you become, I think, more savvy." (p.19-20)

**Codes**: lose-sense-of-awe, meet-great-and-not-so-great, seasoning, learn-to-be-skeptical, become-savvy
**Memo**: White House experience as inoculation against sycophancy - "you lose any sense of awe." Meeting "every head of state" shows "the great, the near great, the not so great as you thought." This demystification is protective factor - less likely to be awed by title or position. "Learn to be skeptical; you learn that what you see is not always what you get." But this is post-White House reflection - doesn't mean he maintained this skepticism while inside.

### 24. Pressure Compared to Movie Business
> "I started making films and I can remember chewing out a writer about something, saying, 'you're late.' He said, 'You can't take pressure, can you?' The writer was a Hollywood writer; he had been goofing off and everything. I said, 'You think this is pressure?' I talked to people in the movie business saying: 'The pressure, the pressure; let me tell you pressure; let me tell you embarrassment.' So you learn to roll with the punches a lot more, know the situation." (p.20)

**Codes**: white-house-pressure, you-think-this-is-pressure, learn-to-roll-with-punches
**Memo**: White House creates high tolerance for pressure. Hollywood writer complaining about pressure and Rafshoon: "You think this is pressure? Let me tell you pressure; let me tell you embarrassment." This high-pressure environment can create sycophancy - when stakes are so high, safer to agree than disagree. But also can create opposite - people who've been through it together aren't impressed by ordinary threats.

### 25. Media Dinners: Missed Opportunity
> "Well, it wasn't hard to sell. He liked it. The whole idea, my idea, was that we'd have everybody. We'd have the dinner, say we'd have Washington Post and NBC Tonight. It would be Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee and John Chancellor and Tom Brokaw, people he wasn't seeing on a regular basis...My hope was that he would get to see who he liked and didn't like, and possibly then start cultivating, continuing a friendship. It didn't quite work that way. He compartmentalized his life in many respects. If you told him: 'Have a dinner once a week with these people,' it was fine and probably I was at fault. I should have continued doing that. But after the first round, I said, 'Would you like to continue?' He said, 'Sure. Who would you like me to have?' I figured it was time for him to get to know people." (p.14)

**Codes**: media-dinners, compartmentalized-life, missed-opportunity-for-friendships, carter-didnt-follow-up, who-would-you-like-me-to-have
**Memo**: Rafshoon arranged dinners for Carter to cultivate media relationships, but Carter didn't follow through. "He compartmentalized his life in many respects." Would do dinners when scheduled but didn't initiate. "Who would you like me to have?" - treating it as duty not opportunity. Shows Carter's limits in political relationship-building. Not willing to be "sycophantic" to media by cultivating them. Rafshoon: "There was an opportunity there—that was missed because he could have—Ben Bradlee is a real good friend of mine. I always said, 'You and Jimmy would have gotten along.'"

### 26. Carter "Didn't Suffer Fools Gladly"
> "He got to know Hedley Donovan who used to come down to Georgia but he was editor of Time at the time. He knew Scotty Reston [New York Times columnist] and he would meet with them. But he didn't suffer fools gladly. There were columnists who would come in and start giving him advice; they thought they were principals. He was a little skeptical about that." (p.14)

**Codes**: didnt-suffer-fools-gladly, columnists-thought-they-were-principals, skeptical-of-advice
**Memo**: Carter resistant to people who "thought they were principals" - columnists coming in to give advice. This is anti-sycophancy in that Carter wouldn't defer to media eminences. But also shows difficulty with political relationship-building. Rafshoon's frustration that Carter didn't cultivate people who could help him. Carter's authenticity (not pretending to value advice he didn't) conflicted with political necessity (making people feel valued).

### 27. Joe Kraft "Like a Conduit from the Shah"
> "Joe Kraft made a trip to Iran, and then he said he wanted to see the President. I figured he really wanted to talk to him and get his ideas about Iran. I put them together and Carter was just appalled. He [Kraft] started saying, 'I've seen Colonel so and so…' It was like he was a conduit from the Shah. He was like trying to advise on policy. But those people, that kind of thing, is obsolete now." (p.14-15)

**Codes**: kraft-as-conduit, appalled-at-advice, trying-to-advise-policy, columnist-obsolescence
**Memo**: Carter "appalled" when columnist Joe Kraft came in acting "like a conduit from the Shah" rather than seeking information. Kraft "trying to advise on policy." Carter's negative reaction to being treated as needing advice from journalist. This is principal refusing to be deferential to media figures. But politically damaging - Kraft probably wrote negative columns afterward.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Cabinet Government Mistake**: Letting cabinet secretaries hire their own people (Kennedy/Udall supporters) rather than Carter loyalists - couldn't "speak with one voice"

2. **Georgia Mafia as Anti-Sycophancy Model**: Four core people (Jordan, Powell, Caddell, Rafshoon) "not turf conscious," could "talk frankly," knew "loser of an argument" wouldn't be "out"

3. **Washington Insiders More Sycophantic**: Never disagreed with president, came to Georgia people when they had concerns - Califano exemplifying false compliance

4. **Proximity Reduces Objectivity**: Rafshoon "lost detachment," started "hunkering down," became "hesitant to bother the President" after coming inside

5. **"Too Close to President" Problem**: Both Powell and Rafshoon identified as "too close" - loyalty interfered with functional effectiveness

6. **Truth as Strategy**: "Telling the truth is a good strategy. Believing in something and being true to it is a better strategy"

7. **Reagan Model of Message Discipline**: "Didn't care what those idiots out there wanted; it was what's best for the president" - refusing to accommodate everyone's demands

8. **Polling for Message, Not Policy**: Carter wouldn't change policy based on polls - used only for communications strategy

9. **Seeing Burden Reduces Confrontation**: When seeing Carter's burden, Rafshoon couldn't deliver criticism: "Nothing, Mr. President"

10. **Democrats Undermining from Hill**: Own party members creating negative stories because Carter "didn't come with their permission"

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Letting cabinet pick own people (not Carter loyalists)
- Idealistic approach to cabinet government
- Carter as outsider without Hill relationships
- Proximity creating empathy for presidential burden
- High-pressure environment with high stakes
- Carter's compartmentalized approach to relationships

**Manifestations**:
- Califano: surface compliance, behind-scenes undermining
- Washington insiders: never disagreeing in meetings
- Rafshoon: becoming "hesitant to bother" after coming inside
- Staff "hunkering down" and buying into "this is tough"
- Constituencies demanding mention in State of Union
- "You're late" mentality - everything high priority

**Protective Factors**:
- Long shared history (Georgia mafia)
- Carter wouldn't tolerate turf battles
- "Loser of argument" not punished
- Could say "You are full of shit, Mr. President"
- Understanding his moods - strategic influence not confrontation
- Outside advisers maintaining distance
- Belief in rightness of cause
- "Lose any sense of awe" from White House experience

**Consequences**:
- Cabinet members saying "entirely different thing" from White House
- Congressional confusion: "You guys for or against this?"
- Message discipline failures
- State of Union as laundry list not theme
- Missing opportunities to cultivate media
- Staff protecting president from himself
- Need for "firmer" approach to keep focus

**Failed Protective Measures**:
- Outside consultants (Rafshoon) lost objectivity when came inside
- Media dinners - Carter didn't follow through on cultivation
- Clinton administration rejecting advice from predecessors
