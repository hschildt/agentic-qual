# Ronald Reagan/George H.W. Bush Transitions - Roman Popadiuk Interview
**Date**: November 2, 1999
**Interviewee**: Roman Popadiuk (NSC Press Office, Reagan 1986-1989; Bush 1989-1992)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Popadiuk served in NSC press operations across two administrations, starting in the Situation Room in Reagan administration (Feb 1985), then moving to NSC Press Office (July 1986), eventually becoming head of NSC Press Office under Bush. The interview focuses extensively on press operations, relationships with NSC staff, briefing preparations, and the challenges of getting information from policy staff who view information as secretive. Key themes include learning on-the-job, building trust through credibility, navigating NSC staff resistance to sharing information, and the importance of access to the National Security Adviser as source of organizational power.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Learning On-The-Job - No Preparation
> "I had absolutely no knowledge at that time of press relations. But that's how I got into the White House Press Office, the bottom rung, assistant press secretary type of thing... First day on the job, July 14, I think it was... It was under Dan that I started learning a lot of the stuff. I learned very quickly you had to have a certain amount of humor about yourself, a certain amount of willingness to chitchat with the press, honesty obviously being a factor all the time, and just common courtesy; getting back to the press on deadlines and stuff. So, you just learned on the ropes. There was no particular course that you took or words of wisdom or anything that you read, quite frankly." (p.2)

**Codes**: learning-on-job, no-formal-training, trial-and-error, sink-or-swim
**Memo**: Popadiuk had zero press experience but was hired by Speakes based on familiarity (seeing him in Situation Room). Learned by doing, no books, no training. This ad hoc approach means people develop their own understanding of role through experience rather than institutional norms. Could enable or prevent sycophancy depending on what patterns they absorb.

### 2. NSC Staff Information Hoarding - Secrecy Mindset
> "There's an awful tendency on the part of policymakers, particularly the NSC staffers—I'm [not] talking about the deputy national security adviser or the national security adviser—to hold onto their information and to regard it as very, very secretive, sensitive⎯and can't be shared with the press. That comes from a different side of the world. Where, I have to share things with the press, because I have to explain things to the press." (p.8)

**Codes**: information-hoarding, secrecy-culture, nsc-gatekeeping, conflicting-roles
**Memo**: NSC policy staff view information as secret by default; press staff need to share to do their job. This creates structural tension. Antecedent: different professional norms (policy vs. communications). This isn't sycophancy per se, but creates environment where some staff guard access to information/principal as source of power.

### 3. NSC Staffer Marking Published Story as Secret
> "I go to the relevant NSC official that deals with this issue and I say, 'I need guidance on this.'... I gave the guy a copy of the story, and went back to talk to him. He sat me down and he gave me the story, and each paragraph of that story was marked Secret, Confidential or Top Secret. I said, 'What are you doing? This is front-page Washington Post. The world knows about this! You're not going to start telling me, \"This is Secret?\"' That gives you an idea of how they perceive the information. And their argument is: 'Nobody knows that this is Secret, so if you don't tell them it's Secret, they won't know that it's Secret.' It's irrelevant to what I tell them. They've read it. They're going to believe it. Because it's in the Washington Post." (p.8)

**Codes**: absurd-secrecy, bureaucratic-rigidity, classification-mindset, reality-denial
**Memo**: NSC staffer marked already-published Washington Post story as classified at different levels. This reveals mindset that treats information control as paramount even when irrational. Not sycophancy to president, but to bureaucratic procedures and classification system. Shows how organizational cultures can be divorced from reality.

### 4. Building Trust with NSC Staff - Key to Getting Information
> "One of the most important things that any press officer has to undertake is: not only build a good relationship with the press, but he has to work just as hard on building a good relationship with the people on the NSC staff. And that means, basically, talking with them, gaining their trust. So, when you [are] give[n] information, they trust that you know how much to use, and what not to use. Because, their mindset is totally different." (p.8)

**Codes**: relationship-building, trust-cultivation, internal-lobbying, bridging-cultures
**Memo**: Popadiuk emphasizes need to work "just as hard" building relationships with NSC staff as with press. This is not sycophancy but strategic relationship management. Must earn trust of policy staff to get information needed to do job. Protective factor: professional credibility rather than compliance-seeking.

### 5. Access to Scowcroft as Source of Organizational Power
> "It's extremely important, in that position, for the press officer to have the confidence of the national security adviser. The person who deals on Africa only enters that office when dealing with Africa. The person who deals with South America only enters that office when dealing with South America. If the issue is Bosnia, those two people are not going to be there. The only person who has access across-the-board is the press officer. And the NSC staff knows that. And if your principal, the national security adviser, trusts you to sit in on sessions or shares information with you, then that has a ripple effect. That kind of gives the signal to the rest of the staff that this person can't be ostracized because if he or she is ostracized, and it goes to the boss, the boss says, 'You have to help out.'" (p.9)

**Codes**: access-as-power, principal-confidence, ripple-effect, gatekeeper-dynamics, cross-cutting-access
**Memo**: Critical insight: press officer is ONLY person with across-the-board access to national security adviser. Regional/functional staff only enter for their issues. If Scowcroft trusts press officer, that signals to staff they must cooperate. This is structural power through proximity to principal. Antecedent: principal's trust. Consequence: staff cooperation. Not sycophancy, but shows how access to principal confers organizational power.

### 6. Cultivating Access Through Daily Presence
> "I always made a point of hanging out in Brent's office every day, just to stop by to say hello. And the NSC staffers would be sitting there to go in, standing there to go in. I would cut the line sometimes, because I had to go see Brent, and Brent would say, 'Let Roman in first, before the policy guys come in, because I had an urgent query from the press I have to deal with.' So, when they see that kind of stuff, that's very important. And just to stop by and say hello to the secretaries, and share a piece of candy when he comes out of his office, or something. That I found was very, very important: to have that good relationship with Scowcroft." (p.9)

**Codes**: cultivating-access, daily-presence, visible-priority, secretary-relationships, informal-power
**Memo**: Popadiuk "hung out" in Scowcroft's office daily, would "cut the line" of waiting NSC staffers when Scowcroft prioritized press queries. This visibility of preferential access signals importance to other staff. Also cultivated secretaries (classic power move). This is strategic relationship management, not sycophancy - maintaining access through being helpful and available, not through flattery or compliance.

### 7. Policy Staff Don't Understand Press Officer Role
> "Anyone that was on the policy side and listened to this would say, 'Gee, I wouldn't put up with that stuff! How could they hound you and be so rough on you? I wouldn't tell those guys anything. Who are they?' Well, that's very easy for you to say. You're behind closed doors⎯type of stuff. But it was very seldom—. They would say, 'You did a good job....' But very seldom, 'I can understand what your job is about, and now I've walked in your shoes. I'm going to help you from now on.' No. I didn't get that kind of stuff. Maybe Marlin was lucky, but I didn't get that kind of feedback. It's a whole different world. The policy guys just don't see it." (p.18)

**Codes**: lack-of-empathy, different-worldviews, policy-vs-press, no-role-understanding
**Memo**: Even when policy staff watch difficult press briefings, they don't gain empathy for press officer's job. They see press as adversary: "first inclination is to put a wall up around yourself. The first wall they want to throw up is you: 'Go out there and tell them to get lost.'" Shows fundamental divide between policy and communications cultures. Not about sycophancy but about organizational silos and incompatible professional norms.

### 8. Iran-Contra - NSC Keeping Press Office in Dark
> "The closest we came to that was probably in the Iran-Contra debacle which broke in November, back in 1986... At that time I was [not] in my current position; I was still an underling, kind of. This is one of those ironies of history, because I had worked in the Situation Room where we had dealt with [Marine Corps Colonel] Ollie North, hostage situations; we had all the compartmentalized information kind of stuff... I remember when the issue of [TOW] missiles was coming up and [Speakes] would go to Poindexter's office and he'd keep me in his office. He'd run back and tell me what Poindexter said and, in order to protect me, he would say, 'Just give me a yes or no; am I on the right track?' And I'd say, 'I think you need to go back and ask him a little bit more.' That's how he found out about missiles and things that fly. So, to a great extent, the NSC was not telling us what had actually transpired. That was the only time, I think, in my press experience that I was really faced with something like that. But I was protected because I knew a little bit more than the NSC thought anyone outside of it really knew because I had worked in the Situation Room and we had seen some of these messages and stuff like that." (p.11)

**Codes**: information-withholding, iran-contra, protecting-subordinate, compartmentalization, prior-knowledge-protective
**Memo**: Only time Popadiuk was misled was Iran-Contra - Poindexter wasn't telling Speakes the truth. Speakes tried to protect Popadiuk by only asking yes/no questions. Popadiuk's prior Situation Room experience meant he knew more than NSC realized, so could guide Speakes to ask better questions. This shows deliberate information control during scandal. Wallison interview described same dynamic - Poindexter keeping everyone out.

### 9. Unauthorized High-Level Backgrounding
> "Some of them do, over a course of time. They learn that, and of course some of them that learn it very well, start doing their own backgrounding⎯without telling you... That's right. That creates a whole series of issues, and you wake up in the morning and a high White House official said X, Y, and Z and the Chief of Staff wants to know who it was. I'm not going to go looking for who it was." (p.18)

**Codes**: unauthorized-leaks, senior-staff-freelancing, loss-of-control, high-level-backgrounding
**Memo**: Once NSC staff learn value of press relationships, some start doing their own backgrounding without coordination. Creates "high White House official said..." stories that Chief of Staff wants to track down. Press office won't investigate. This is staff acting independently, potentially undercutting coordination. Not sycophancy but shows limits of control over senior staff.

### 10. "That's a Great Idea, Sir" - Deflection Technique
> MK: "It's like, what happens if a president has an idea on a policy that probably is not too wise."
> RP: "'That's a great idea, sir; we'll look into that.' That's basically what it was." (p.19)

**Codes**: deflection-strategy, managing-up, strategic-agreement, letting-it-die
**Memo**: When president or other senior official has bad idea or wants to track down leaker, standard response is "That's a great idea, sir; we'll look into that" then let it die because "usually they forget about it, anyway. They're too busy." This is strategic deference - appearance of compliance without actual compliance. Marlin Fitzwater's approach to managing unwanted demands from senior officials.

### 11. Building Credibility to Protect Principals
> "I operated under the personal notion of full disclosure, to have the reporter have, without giving away 'state' secrets or things of that nature, as much information as possible. Because I felt that made a better story for us; built a trust by the reporter and me personally, and in my office, and as a result of that gave me more credibility in the future with that reporter. If I needed something deleted, I could argue... I can give you a generic example that you'll recall very quickly: 'Air Sununu' stories. [General Brent] Scowcroft, I think, took one or two flights in a similar vein; they could have been considered personal. But I had cultivated the press very assiduously on his behalf and [it] worked very nicely, and as far as I know his name didn't creep up [negatively] in any stories. But you know what happened to John Sununu." (p.25)

**Codes**: credibility-as-currency, full-disclosure-strategy, protecting-principal, press-cultivation, strategic-transparency
**Memo**: Popadiuk's strategy: be maximally forthcoming with press (short of secrets) to build credibility, so when you need to protect principal you have capital to spend. Sununu got hammered for personal use of government aircraft; Scowcroft did similar but Popadiuk had "cultivated the press very assiduously on his behalf" so Scowcroft's name didn't appear negatively. This is strategic loyalty - protecting principal through credibility, not through lying or hiding. Protective factor: earned trust with press.

### 12. Learning Boundaries Through Experience, Not Training
> MK: "How did you learn the differences on what you could say? For example, say on a story that a reporter brings to you, you couldn't tell him things to add to his story. But, on the other hand, you could say, 'You might want to work on that second paragraph, or search around a little more on that paragraph.'"
> RP: "That's exactly how we would say it sometimes."
> MK: "How do you learn that kind of thing? How you do that, of what you can and can't do?"
> RP: "First of all, there were negatives, and there were positives... I operated under the personal notion of full disclosure... I can't tell you how you learn that. It seems logical to do business that way because, first of all, you're building your credibility, you're building trust and you have something in the bank for the future... I can tell you where I didn't learn it much easier than where I learned it. I didn't learn it from books; I didn't learn it from any one single individual. You just kind of learned it on the job." (p.24-26)

**Codes**: learning-by-doing, tacit-knowledge, no-formal-training, professional-judgment, intuitive-learning
**Memo**: Popadiuk can't articulate how he learned what to say/not say to reporters - "learned it on the job," not from books or training. This is tacit knowledge developed through trial and error. Means norms get transmitted informally through observation and mistakes rather than explicit teaching. Variability in how different people learn role could lead to different approaches to loyalty, transparency, etc.

### 13. Bush vs. Reagan - Different Press Styles
> "Reagan was more—I don't say this in a pejorative term—malleable in terms of—you've heard the scripts and things like that. We had elaborate East Room press conferences where he'd walk down the red carpet and look very presidential. He liked that kind of stuff and I think the people that dealt with him liked to do that kind of stuff. Bush tended to be less scripted. He liked off-the-cuff comments. He liked to walk into the press briefing room and hold his news conference. I think during Bush we only had one East Room press conference, if I'm not mistaken... Everything else was either in room 450 or off-the-cuff talking to the press or impromptu or, even if it was scheduled, it was in the briefing room." (p.26)

**Codes**: presidential-style-differences, scripted-vs-spontaneous, formality-vs-informality, reagan-vs-bush
**Memo**: Reagan preferred elaborate scripted East Room events - "liked that kind of stuff." Bush preferred informal briefing room, off-the-cuff. Different presidential styles require different staff approaches. Reagan's formality could enable more staff control/choreography (potentially more sycophantic staging). Bush's informality harder to control, more authentic but less "presidential" visually.

### 14. Reagan's Minimal Press Conference Prep
> "For President Bush usually what it involved was Marlin would say give me a list of the top ten questions... Then he would take them in to the Oval Office—sometimes I would go with him—and sit there. Scowcroft would be there and [Bob] Gates and Marlin, and the President would take the sheet, lean back in his chair and read each question aloud and muse to himself, 'I think I've got that one.' Very seldom would he say 'Gee, number three. What's the answer on this?' Very seldom; hardly ever. Maybe once or twice in his whole presidency would he kind of fidget what the answer on that one should be or is... He'd say, 'Brent, is that what we should be saying?' Scowcroft would usually say, 'Yes.' That would be the preparation."
> MK: "How long would it take?"
> RP: "If it took more than five minutes I was surprised. You just walk in; here's the paper; boom, boom, boom and you're out. We'd give the signal for the press conference, the two-minute warning and he'd walk out and do the briefing." (p.27-28)

**Codes**: minimal-preparation, presidential-confidence, bush-competence, quick-review, scowcroft-validation
**Memo**: Bush's press conference prep was minimal - read list of likely questions, muse "I think I've got that one," quick check with Scowcroft, done in 5 minutes. Contrast with Reagan's elaborate two-day mock briefings with full staff. Bush's confidence and knowledge meant didn't need extensive prep. Not sycophancy-related directly, but shows different presidents have different needs - staff must adapt. Bush didn't need/want extensive coaching; Reagan did.

### 15. Reagan's Elaborate Press Conference Preparation
> "In the Reagan years there were two things that we did. Number one, we prepared a briefing book for the President which basically had major issues in bullets—kind of apartheid in South Africa?—three points he should make. Usually what the President did is take that up to Camp David with him every Friday afternoon and study it or review it during the course of the weekend. Then a day or two before the press conference we'd have two days of mock briefings with President Reagan. We'd hold that in the family theater in the East Wing of the White House... You would have the senior staff and sometimes a relevant cabinet member come in and sit in the theater seats there. The press officers, including myself, would sit at a table; the President would stand at a podium actually, and we'd ask him questions... I tended to be a little bit more tenacious because I would always interject, interrupt him or ask a follow-up question to try to stumble him." (p.27)

**Codes**: elaborate-preparation, mock-briefings, reagan-preparation, testing-president, adversarial-prep
**Memo**: Reagan had extensive prep - briefing book to Camp David on weekends, then two days of mock briefings with full staff in theater. Popadiuk "tried to stumble him" with tough follow-ups. This extensive preparation could be seen as staff managing/controlling president's performance. But Popadiuk's role was to challenge, not defer. Protective factor: adversarial preparation rather than softball questions.

### 16. Psychic Rewards of White House Service
> "The benefits are, if you're a kid from Brooklyn, the chances of you ever working at the White House were so farfetched that, when you have it, you're thrilled. I think it's just, I don't want to say honor, the challenge; this is the top of the government. To work at the White House you feel privileged and you get your benefits out of that... You get a sense of that when you go into the Oval Office. You get a real sense of it if you're there alone. There'd be times I'd walk in and the President would go to his study or something, to get something, and you're left alone standing in the Oval Office in the middle of the rug. You look around the most powerful office in the world—remember your textbooks and everything—and you kind of say, 'I'm here; what a unique opportunity to serve your country.' It sounds kind of corny to you but it's true; it really goes through you: the sense that you're really helping serve your country; you're doing something very useful and you're proud to be part of it, part of history." (p.31)

**Codes**: psychic-rewards, feeling-privileged, serving-country, pride-in-service, awe-of-office
**Memo**: "Kid from Brooklyn" in Oval Office - profound sense of privilege and service. Standing alone in Oval Office gives "sense that you're really helping serve your country." This emotional/psychological attachment to office and mission could be antecedent to sycophancy - awe and gratitude making it harder to resist or speak truth to power. But Popadiuk immediately adds: "The main thing is not to have an ego about it... you were privileged to work in that kind of environment and then when your time comes, you leave. You can't be full of yourself."

### 17. Avoiding Ego and Knowing When to Leave
> "That feeling of having that kind of position and doing that kind of work, I think, stays with you day in and day out, whether it's the first day or the last day. The main thing is not to have an ego about it. The main thing is to be able to recognize that you were privileged to work in that kind of environment and then when your time comes, you leave. You can't be full of yourself and have a big ego, although Washington is full of people with big egos. You just accept what's there, you do your job and you go on. And that's it." (p.31)

**Codes**: avoiding-ego, humble-service, knowing-when-to-leave, perspective-maintenance, anti-self-importance
**Memo**: Popadiuk emphasizes NOT having ego - "you were privileged to work... and then when your time comes, you leave. You can't be full of yourself." Recognizes temptation: "Washington is full of people with big egos." This is protective factor against sycophancy: maintaining perspective that position is temporary privilege, not personal power. Humility and recognition of when to exit.

### 18. Press in Building - Constant Exposure
> "It's tough. I was protected because my office was in the OEOB so I could leave whenever I wanted to. Marlin was always sitting there; they knew he was in there, and they'd just sit out there and wait. It's tough. You can't go to the men's room or the ladies' room without running into them. You can't walk out to go upstairs to talk to somebody or to the Chief of Staff without running into them. You can't get a candy bar in the back without running into them, because all the machines are in the back. So basically your life is not your own in that respect and you're always running on a sense of adrenaline and always trying to be on your best because even when it's friendly banter, there's always a question in there." (p.30)

**Codes**: constant-exposure, no-privacy, press-proximity, always-on-duty, adrenaline-state
**Memo**: Press in building = constant exposure. "Your life is not your own... always running on a sense of adrenaline and always trying to be on your best because even when it's friendly banter, there's always a question in there." This constant scrutiny creates pressure that could drive defensive behavior or information control. But Popadiuk also notes benefits: immediate access to correct stories, build relationships. Not about sycophancy but shows unique pressures of Press Office role.

### 19. Benefits of Press Proximity
> "There are benefits because you can touch the world immediately; there's no doubt about it. You can correct a story immediately; you can also create a problem easily, too, if you misspeak. So it's a two-edged sword. So I see it more as a benefit in that respect. It also builds up—if you're willing to mingle—Marlin, I mentioned, would smoke his cigar. I would go back to get a candy bar or something; I'd just walk by the booths and say, 'How are you doing?' I'd also make sure to walk downstairs—because CNN and the radio people downstairs always felt left out—just to visit, just to say, 'Hi; I'm not spinning anything; I'm not bringing news; I just wanted to see how you were doing?'... So you get an idea of what they're working on; you get to know them a little bit better." (p.30)

**Codes**: relationship-building, informal-contact, intelligence-gathering, press-cultivation, accessibility
**Memo**: Popadiuk deliberately cultivated press through informal visits - "just to see how you were doing" - which let him learn what they're working on, build relationships, establish trust. This is strategic relationship management that pays off when need to protect principals. Compare to Roussel's similar emphasis on building genuine friendships with press. Protective factor: authentic relationships rather than manipulation.

### 20. Credibility as Currency - Mike McCurry Example
> "Mike McCurry was a classic case. When Mike spoke on⎯I forget which issue⎯it was about a year into his job. What was the issue? And there was a story that he shot himself in his foot, his credibility—. What was the issue? You should know this; you're doing research... It was about a year, year-and-a-half into the job and there were the stories about he's going to have to resign because of his credibility, and yet he survived, and everybody forgave him—because he had been so outgoing and forthcoming. It's the same rationale... The more forthcoming you are—and of course, you have to protect yourself with certain rules. You don't do everything 'on-the-record.' You do 'background,' 'deep-background' type of situations." (p.25-26)

**Codes**: credibility-as-capital, surviving-mistakes, press-forgiveness, mccurry-example, strategic-transparency
**Memo**: McCurry survived credibility crisis because he had been "so outgoing and forthcoming" - built up capital with press that carried him through mistake. Popadiuk emphasizes this principle: be maximally transparent (within boundaries) to build credibility that protects you when things go wrong. This is strategic anti-sycophancy: serve principal best by being truthful with press, not by hiding/spinning everything.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **NSC Staff Information Hoarding**: Policy staff default to secrecy, view press as threat, must be cultivated to share information
2. **Access to Principal as Organizational Power**: Press officer's unique across-the-board access to NSC Adviser signals to staff they must cooperate
3. **Strategic Relationship Management**: Building trust with both press and NSC staff through credibility, not compliance
4. **Iran-Contra Information Control**: Poindexter deliberately kept press office in dark during scandal
5. **Unauthorized Senior Staff Leaks**: Once staff learn press value, some do own backgrounding without coordination
6. **"That's a Great Idea, Sir" Deflection**: Strategy for managing unwanted presidential/senior official demands - appear to agree, then let it die
7. **Credibility as Protective Currency**: Being forthcoming with press builds capital that protects principal (Scowcroft vs. Sununu example)
8. **Learning Tacit Norms Through Experience**: No formal training, just figuring out boundaries through trial and error
9. **Different Presidential Styles**: Reagan needed elaborate preparation/choreography; Bush minimally scripted, confident
10. **Psychic Rewards and Ego Avoidance**: Profound sense of privilege serving country, but must avoid ego and know when to leave

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- NSC staff professional norms: default to secrecy and compartmentalization
- Lack of formal training: people learn role informally, absorbing local culture
- Awe of office and privilege: "kid from Brooklyn" in Oval Office creates emotional attachment
- Crisis context: Iran-Contra creating pressure for information control
- Structural tensions: policy staff vs. communications staff conflicting missions

**Manifestations**:
- NSC staff marking already-published stories as classified (absurd secrecy)
- Information hoarding and gatekeeping by policy staff
- Access to principal used as signal of organizational power
- "That's a great idea, sir" deflection technique (strategic deference without compliance)
- Unauthorized backgrounding by senior staff (acting independently)

**Protective Factors**:
- Building credibility through transparency rather than spin
- Adversarial press conference preparation (trying to "stumble" Reagan with tough questions)
- Professional relationships with press based on trust, not manipulation
- Avoiding ego: "you were privileged... and then when your time comes, you leave"
- Financial independence: not being career-dependent
- Strategic loyalty: protect principal through earned credibility, not through lying
- Cross-institutional relationships: knowing people across agencies reduces dependency on any single patron

**Consequences**:
- Policy staff lack empathy for press office role even after watching difficult briefings
- Effective principals protected (Scowcroft) when credibility established; others exposed (Sununu)
- Press forgiveness when credibility banked (McCurry survived his mistake)
- Organizational dysfunction when information hoarded (Iran-Contra)
- Staff acting independently when not coordinated (unauthorized backgrounding)

## Notable Contrasts

**Reagan vs. Bush Press Styles**: Reagan elaborately scripted, two days mock briefings, formal East Room events; Bush minimal 5-minute prep, informal briefing room, off-the-cuff

**Popadiuk's Strategy vs. Potential Sycophancy**: Maximized transparency to build credibility that protects principal vs. hiding/spinning to protect principal short-term

**NSC Policy Staff vs. Press Office**: Default to secrecy and compartmentalization vs. need to share to do job effectively

**Access as Power vs. Access as Service**: Press officer's unique across-the-board access to NSC Adviser gave organizational power, but Popadiuk describes using it to serve mission rather than personal advancement

**Scowcroft vs. Sununu**: Both took questionable government flights; Scowcroft protected because Popadiuk cultivated press credibility; Sununu exposed
