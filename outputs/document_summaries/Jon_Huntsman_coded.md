# Richard M. Nixon Transition - Jon Huntsman Interview
**Date**: February 25, 2000
**Interviewee**: Jon Huntsman (Staff Secretary)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Huntsman was Staff Secretary (1971-1972), managing all paper flow to/from President and controlling White House administrative functions (budget, offices, salaries, perks). Left after exactly one year, "burned out" from 15-hour days and Haldeman's terrorizing management. This interview provides extraordinarily detailed and explicit descriptions of fear-based sycophancy in the Nixon White House - Haldeman's intimidation tactics, zero-defect expectations, and the long-term psychological impact on staff. Notable for candid assessment: "terrorizing time in my life" and learning "how not to treat people."

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Professional vs. Campaign Loyalist Hiring
> "I think they were more concerned to have a professional running that end of the business than someone with a political history or a history with the President's campaign. I was a Nixon supporter, but I had never met anybody in the White House. I shook hands once with Bob Haldeman when he gave a speech in Los Angeles but, short of that, I didn't know anyone. It seemed to be critical that they have knowledgeable, experienced people." (p.3)

**Codes**: professional-hiring, expertise-over-loyalty, campaign-vs-professional
**Memo**: Huntsman brought in as professional, not loyalist - hired for management expertise. Contrast to campaign workers. This sets up tension throughout interview - professionals as "second-class citizens" despite being needed for actual governance. Non-sycophantic hiring criteria but creates two-tier system.

### 2. Zero-Defect System Expectations
> "Haldeman insisted, on the first day I walked in, that I knew how to do this job. To the contrary—I didn't really know what he was talking about. I had to figure it out in three to four days. [...] You wanted a zero-defect system. It's impossible to achieve zero-defect, but we've come very close to it. You've been on my back a couple of times, and almost every time, you've been wrong in your criticism—I've had the thing in the file or in the hopper and was moving forward." (p.4)

**Codes**: zero-defect-expectations, impossible-standards, snap-judgment-criticism
**Memo**: No learning curve allowed. "Zero-defect" demand creates fear-based compliance rather than innovation. Huntsman notes Haldeman's criticism "almost every time" wrong - but damage done through intimidation. Antecedent: perfectionism. Consequence: staff terror, defensive behavior, focus on appearance over substance.

### 3. Haldeman's Delegation from Nixon
> "Haldeman ran the White House. The President didn't, Haldeman did. The President had very little input as to how the White House operated. He turned it over to Haldeman. He gave him the broad parameters and Haldeman implemented the strategy." (p.8)

**Codes**: delegated-authority, haldeman-control, presidential-detachment
**Memo**: Critical insight - Nixon delegated White House operations entirely to Haldeman. This empowered Haldeman's reign of terror. Shows presidential responsibility for enabling sycophancy through abdication. "The President didn't, Haldeman did" - stark statement of power transfer.

### 4. System Stimulating Unusual Behavior (Watergate Antecedent)
> "I think it led to people trying desperately hard to maybe get attention in a world that was very effective and very efficient. It was hard for anyone to get his head above the crowd unless he did something unusual. Therefore, the format may have stimulated people to do things a little out of the ordinary to get attention because it wasn't one of these things where somebody could bring the President an idea or a suggestion without it being properly staffed." (p.8)

**Codes**: attention-seeking-behavior, watergate-antecedent, system-perversity, unusual-actions
**Memo**: Extraordinary insight linking efficient control system to Watergate. Tight system meant "hard for anyone to get his head above the crowd unless he did something unusual." Antecedent: excessive control + need for recognition. Consequence: staff doing "things a little out of the ordinary to get attention" = Watergate. Sycophancy paradox: rigid compliance breeds rule-breaking to gain favor.

### 5. Haldeman's Intimidation - Initial Encounter
> "He roared into my office. The door flew open and Haldeman was there screaming at the top of his voice, 'If you think H stands for Huntsman and not Haldeman, you're one dumb son of a bitch.' I didn't even know what he was talking about." (p.17)

**Codes**: intimidation, screaming, humiliation, power-display
**Memo**: Within five days of starting, Haldeman screaming "you're one dumb son of a bitch" at Huntsman for innocent error (not knowing initial system). Classic terrorizing management - disproportionate rage for minor mistake. Creates fear-based compliance. "I didn't even know what he was talking about" shows arbitrary nature of punishment.

### 6. Professional vs. Campaign Staff - Second Class Citizens
> "Pat Buchanan and Haldeman and Ehrlichman and a number of others were all campaign workers. They all had easy access to the President because they were campaign guys. We professionals, even compared to Nixon supporters way down to the grassroots level, were second-class citizens. Not in the sense that we didn't have full openness to everything, it was just that the Attorney General, John Mitchell, and those who had been part of the early campaign seemed always to have a leg up on the professionals." (p.10-11)

**Codes**: campaign-vs-professional, second-class-status, loyalty-over-expertise, access-hierarchy
**Memo**: Two-tier system: campaign loyalists (sycophants) had "easy access" and "leg up" over professionals. Despite needing professionals' expertise, they were "second-class citizens." Antecedent: early loyalty valued over competence. Manifestation: access hierarchy. Shows sycophancy as currency - campaign time bought status regardless of current performance.

### 7. "Cookie Cutter" Team - Conformity
> "We were all out of the same cookie cutter. We were bright, young, early thirties, late twenties, fairly good looking, guys of some accomplishment, at least. Jeb Magruder, John Dean, we're all out of the same cookie mold. No women. No older guys in those positions. It was very much a star-studded lineup. [...] Everybody had to wear a white shirt with Nixon." (p.15)

**Codes**: homogeneity, conformity, uniformity, cookie-cutter-staff, no-diversity
**Memo**: Explicit homophily - "same cookie cutter," all young men, no women, even dress code (white shirts mandatory). "Star-studded lineup" but treated as interchangeable. Antecedent: deliberate selection for similarity. Consequence: groupthink, lack of diverse perspectives. Sycophancy through sameness - easier to control uniform group.

### 8. Haldeman's Meeting Style - "Speak or Forever Hold Your Breath"
> "I think Haldeman scared people so much. Our meetings started at ten o'clock and Haldeman would be sitting in there [...] in his chair facing the wall, and he had a table there, and six or seven of us would come in and sit around the table. Right at ten o'clock, right smack on the button, he'd spin around and go, 'Shoot.' The first guy would either speak or forever hold his breath. The next guy would speak or forever hold his breath. If you said anything that was silly or inappropriate or out of character, Haldeman would either call you a name or belittle you. So you said what you absolutely had to, and, if you didn't have anything to say, you'd say, 'check' and go on to the next guy." (p.14)

**Codes**: intimidation-tactics, fear-based-meetings, speak-or-silence, name-calling, belittling, no-discussion
**Memo**: Vivid description of terror-based meetings. "Speak or forever hold your breath" - one chance only. Name-calling or belittling for errors. "It wasn't a place where you discussed anything. We turned in and reported—it was turn-in-a-report meeting." Antecedent: Haldeman's intimidation style. Consequence: no real deliberation, defensive reporting, information withholding. Extreme hierarchical sycophancy - say minimum to avoid abuse.

### 9. Inefficiency of Fear-Based "Efficiency"
> MK: "In a sense it doesn't sound efficient because in efficiency you need to bring up all the different kinds of points of view and you need to stimulate discussion. Just to have it be a streamlined, quick reporting operation doesn't seem to do well in the long run."
> JH: "Well, they were abbreviated." (p.14)

**Codes**: false-efficiency, no-deliberation, superficial-reporting, long-term-dysfunction
**Memo**: Kumar identifies core problem: fear-based "efficiency" prevents actual deliberation needed for good decisions. Huntsman's weak response ("abbreviated") suggests he recognizes this but can't fully critique the system he praised elsewhere. Shows cognitive dissonance - he both admires the efficiency and recognizes its dysfunction.

### 10. Threat to Quit Over Speech Incident
> "I'd taken enough of it and I said, 'Bob, I've been yelled at enough. I've done everything in my power to do this job right. I haven't seen my family in six months. Why don't you just take this job and shove it? I'm through.' Wham. I took the speech when it came—I had a White House driver take me out to National Airport. I went aboard an Eastern Airlines jet that was headed for Miami. [...] By the time the courier had arrived down there, the Eastern Airlines guy had arrived and the speech was over to Haldeman. I'd done it my way. Haldeman never said a word." (p.17)

**Codes**: quit-threat, principled-resistance, alternative-solution, standing-up-to-power
**Memo**: Anti-sycophantic moment - "take this job and shove it." Huntsman found creative solution (commercial flight) rather than impossible courier deadline. Haldeman's silence = acknowledgment he'd been wrong. But note: resistance came only after six months of abuse. Protective factor: willingness to walk away. Consequence: earned respect through defiance.

### 11. Haldeman's Apology Through Promotion
> "Larry Higby [...] said, 'Bob wants me to tell you how much he respects you and he wants you to start coming to the ten a.m. meetings.' The ten a.m. meeting was a very big thing in the White House. It shows that you've moved up in the ranks. And that was his way of telling me that I had done it right, to the extent possible. It was his way of apologizing." (p.17)

**Codes**: indirect-communication, status-reward, apology-through-promotion, hierarchy-signal
**Memo**: Haldeman couldn't apologize directly - sent deputy to convey "respect" via meeting invitation. Access to meetings = status currency in this system. Shows sycophantic hierarchy: inclusion in ten a.m. meeting signals you're in favor. Haldeman rewarded defiance (paradoxically) but couldn't communicate like human.

### 12. Refusing to Mix Personal Business with White House Role
> "I got to thinking about it and I didn't ever call our people and didn't get my personal team involved because I just didn't think it had anything to do with my job as the White House staff secretary. So the next morning when Haldeman asked me to return a report, [...] I said, 'Bob, I didn't ask my people to do it because they work for me privately and I didn't want to get them involved in anything in the White House. I'm very sorry. I have to report that I haven't done anything with it because it's not part of my job description.' It just burned him up and he didn't say a word. We'd already had the thing the month before and he knew he couldn't push me." (p.18)

**Codes**: ethical-boundaries, role-clarity, refusing-inappropriate-assignment, repeat-defiance
**Memo**: Second principled refusal - wouldn't use personal business to do White House vetting. "Not part of my job description." Haldeman couldn't respond - "he knew he couldn't push me." Anti-sycophancy: maintaining ethical boundaries despite pressure. Shows that standing up once (speech incident) established pattern where Haldeman backed down.

### 13. Long-Term Psychological Damage from Haldeman
> "What did I learn? I didn't learn anything that's helped me productively. I learned a lot of things that I would not implement in a business. Like Haldeman told me in my exit interview, you can't run a business like this. I have to agree with him 100 per cent. [...] I didn't take anything but fear out. It took me years to get over the fear of Haldeman, the fear of my work not being perfect, and the need to please the President with every little letter in place, every word in place, everything done with a ruler and every briefing paper exactly right." (p.16)

**Codes**: long-term-trauma, fear-legacy, learning-how-not-to-lead, psychological-damage
**Memo**: Devastating assessment. "I didn't take anything but fear out. It took me years to get over the fear of Haldeman." Long-term psychological impact of terrorizing management. "Everything done with a ruler" - obsessive precision from fear. Note even Haldeman admitted "you can't run a business like this." Consequence of extreme sycophancy demands: lasting trauma, not skill development.

### 14. Total Burnout After One Year
> "After a year, I was literally burned out. I had not seen my family, I had not gone anywhere. The scope of my task at the time is now in the hands of several people. I didn't realize it at the time, but it was a fairly powerful position, because we determined who got what offices, who got what limos, who got what perks, who got what salaries. [...] It was a fifteen-hour-day undertaking and, by far, the most difficult job in the White House." (p.2, 4)

**Codes**: burnout, unsustainable-workload, family-sacrifice, impossible-job-scope
**Memo**: "Literally burned out" after exactly one year. 15-hour days, hadn't seen family. Job now requires "four or five people." Impossible scope + zero-defect expectations + Haldeman's abuse = burnout. "Most difficult job in the White House." Left immediately when investors asked. Consequence: talented people driven out, institutional memory lost, sustainability impossible.

### 15. "Terrorizing Time in My Life"
> "Haldeman made it a very difficult experience, a terrorizing time in my life. I had a much better and more effective tenure at HEW with Eliot Richardson. [...] I learned I didn't want to serve in government anymore. [...] You asked what I learned: I learned I didn't want to serve in government anymore. I learned that, even though some of my sons are effective, if I was going to get ahead in life, I'd better carry things on my shoulders and not depend on anyone else who was part of a staff." (p.16-17)

**Codes**: terrorism-descriptor, government-departure, trust-damage, self-reliance
**Memo**: "Terrorizing time in my life" - Huntsman's explicit characterization. Used word "terrorizing" multiple times. Consequence: left government permanently, lost trust in staff/systems, became self-reliant. Compares favorably to HEW under Richardson - shows problem was Haldeman specifically, not government generally. Sycophancy's ultimate cost: losing talented people forever.

### 16. Learning "How Not to Treat People"
> "I kind of learned from Haldeman how not to treat people. I probably learned something about efficiency, but not much. It was a pretty terrorizing time in my life. [...] I think I knew coming in how to run a business because I had been president of a business. Since then I treat people very well. I'm very fair. My handshake is my bond." (p.17)

**Codes**: negative-learning, leadership-by-counterexample, fair-treatment-contrast
**Memo**: Main lesson: "how not to treat people." Built $8 billion company on opposite principles - treating people well, fairness, integrity. Haldeman provided model of what not to do. Protective factor for not replicating sycophancy: had alternative model (Richardson at HEW), prior business success gave confidence, recognized damage done to him.

### 17. Two Camps of Nixon Staff
> "I think you'll see the Nixon guys broken into two kind of camps. On one hand, you had professionals, who were there to really benefit America and the President and who were not guys likely to suffer the least lapses in ethics or integrity. I think Jerry Warren and Herb are two of those guys who, to me, were always straight down the line—straight answers, straight guys. Then you had the kind of twist-and-turn guys who you never quite figured out why they were there or what they were doing or what their mission was. They turned out to be the fellows that have made history." (p.10)

**Codes**: professional-vs-political, ethical-divide, straight-vs-twist, watergate-actors
**Memo**: Huntsman identifies two camps: (1) professionals with ethics (Warren, Klein, Malek) = "straight down the line"; (2) "twist-and-turn guys" = Watergate actors. Suggests sycophancy distinction: genuine service (professionals) vs. unprincipled loyalty (campaign guys who "made history" through scandal). Those who didn't suffer "least lapses in ethics" stayed clean.

### 18. Haldeman's Exit Interview - Can't Run Business This Way
> "I left I told him I thought it had been a horrible experience for me, and we had quite an intense two-hour session. He said, 'I'd never ask you to run a business like this. I'd never run anything else like this.' He was very apologetic. I said, 'Bob, it's horrible. One man should never do this. It's been a nightmare. I've given it everything I've got. I haven't seen my family in a year. I've been totally dedicated. I put ten years' service in here in a year. I suggest you break up the position. You're very hard on people. You're very demanding. You wanted a zero-defect system. It's impossible to achieve zero-defect, but we've come very close to it.'" (p.4)

**Codes**: exit-confrontation, haldeman-admission, system-critique, nightmare-descriptor
**Memo**: Haldeman's telling admission: "I'd never ask you to run a business like this. I'd never run anything else like this." He knew it was abusive but did it anyway in White House context. Huntsman's assessment: "horrible," "nightmare," "one man should never do this," "put ten years' service in here in a year." Even Haldeman apologetic - but didn't change system. Shows conscious choice to terrorize in pursuit of "zero-defect" ideal.

### 19. Nixon's Personal Kindness vs. System's Cruelty
> "To me, the President was very businesslike and the President was a wonderful man to work for. He took a lot of time with me on the side. He always thanked me, he always saw my children. He was kind of my hero. He knew I had a horrible job in terms of keeping him going. He was always very grateful. Haldeman wasn't, but the President was." (p.8)

**Codes**: nixon-kindness, president-vs-chief-of-staff, personal-gratitude, hero-worship
**Memo**: Striking contrast - Nixon personally kind, grateful, saw Huntsman's children; Haldeman terrorizing. "Haldeman wasn't, but the President was." But Nixon empowered Haldeman's system, so kindness rings hollow. Paradox: Huntsman remained Nixon's "hero" despite system Nixon created/enabled. Shows how personal charm can mask systemic abuse.

### 20. Haldeman Setting Tone from Top
> "But it all kind of emanated from Haldeman. He set the tone. The President had little patience for staff. He had little patience for the domestic cabinet offices. [...] Short of that, very few people ever got in. Cabinet meetings were a necessary evil and they were held very infrequently. The Cabinet didn't have any influence at all with the President." (p.10)

**Codes**: tone-from-top, presidential-impatience, cabinet-marginalization, haldeman-as-source
**Memo**: "It all kind of emanated from Haldeman. He set the tone." But grounded in Nixon's "little patience for staff" and domestic Cabinet. Nixon's preferences enabled Haldeman's style. Cabinet meetings "necessary evil," "very infrequently," "didn't have any influence at all." Shows how presidential temperament creates conditions for chief of staff to exercise terrorizing control.

### 21. "Haldeman Scared People So Much"
> "No. I think Haldeman scared people so much." (p.14)

**Codes**: fear-based-control, intimidation-culture, scared-staff
**Memo**: Direct, simple statement in response to question about looking back at initiatives. Fear prevented reflection and learning. "Scared people so much" - understated but powerful. Throughout interview, Huntsman returns to fear as defining characteristic of the system.

### 22. Later Reconciliation with Haldeman
> "We spent about two to three hours together. And he said, 'You never came to see me in jail.' I said, 'I know, Bob. I really didn't want to—you and I didn't leave as the best of friends. You know that better than I do.' He said, 'I understand, Jon.' We warmed up a bit and exchanged some phone calls. Eventually I came to see a different side of Haldeman, quite a mellow side, a side I really did like. I quite respected Bob in his later years." (p.19)

**Codes**: later-reconciliation, mellowing, prison-impact, forgiveness
**Memo**: After prison, Haldeman "quite a mellow side." They "came to enjoy quite a warm and mutually respectful friendship." Shows Haldeman's White House persona was choice, not inherent personality - he could be different. Prison may have provided perspective. Huntsman's ability to reconcile shows he separated person from behavior. But damage to others who didn't get reconciliation.

### 23. Nixon's Post-Funeral Address to Staff
> "Nixon stood up when just the staff was there, right after the funeral, and he called us around him. He said, [...] 'When Tricia and Julie were having their little babies, little children, they came to me and we held a family council to see what they should call me, Grandpa or what. [...] And the kids said, "Dad, what would you like the grandchildren to call you?"' And he said, 'You can call me anything because I've been called everything.' It just broke up the staff. Here was the old Nixon with his fingers up—the victory sign." (p.19)

**Codes**: nixon-humor, self-awareness, staff-reunion, humanizing-moment
**Memo**: Nixon's self-deprecating humor at Pat's funeral - "you can call me anything because I've been called everything." Moment of humanity after death. Staff left "remembering that moment more than our time at the White House." Shows Nixon's charm and ability to connect when he chose. But also poignant - acknowledging his reputation while maintaining the victory sign. Too little, too late for those destroyed by his system.

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Fear-Based Compliance**: "Haldeman scared people so much" - terrorism as management tool, creating compliance through intimidation rather than genuine deference
2. **Long-Term Psychological Damage**: "It took me years to get over the fear" - lasting trauma from zero-defect expectations and constant abuse
3. **Impossible Standards**: Zero-defect system with no learning curve - perfection demanded immediately
4. **Professional vs. Campaign Loyalist Divide**: Professionals "second-class citizens" despite being needed; campaign workers had "leg up" through early loyalty
5. **Homogeneity and Conformity**: "Cookie cutter" team - all young men, no women, even white shirt dress code
6. **System Breeding Rule-Breaking**: Tight control stimulated "unusual" behavior to get attention - Watergate antecedent
7. **No Discussion, Only Reporting**: "Speak or forever hold your breath" meetings - no deliberation, just defensive reporting
8. **Haldeman's Delegated Power**: "Haldeman ran the White House. The President didn't" - Nixon's abdication enabled terror
9. **Learning How Not to Lead**: Main lesson was counterexample - built successful business on opposite principles
10. **Burnout and Talent Loss**: One year = total burnout, left government permanently, lost talented person

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Nixon's delegation of White House operations to Haldeman
- Presidential impatience with staff and Cabinet
- Zero-defect expectations without learning curve
- Campaign vs. professional two-tier system
- Homogeneous hiring (cookie cutter team)
- Nixon's "little patience for staff"

**Manifestations**:
- Screaming, name-calling, belittling in meetings
- "Speak or forever hold your breath" - one chance to report
- Everything "done with a ruler" - obsessive precision from fear
- Indirect communication through deputies
- Access hierarchy (ten a.m. meeting as status symbol)
- Staff saying only what necessary, nothing more
- Professionals as "second-class citizens" despite expertise

**Consequences**:
- Total burnout after one year
- Long-term psychological trauma ("years to get over the fear")
- Talented people leaving government permanently
- System stimulating "unusual" behavior (Watergate antecedent)
- No real deliberation or learning from experience
- Staff doing "things a little out of the ordinary to get attention"
- False efficiency - streamlined reporting without actual discussion
- Loss of trust in staff/systems, extreme self-reliance

**Protective Factors**:
- Prior business success giving confidence
- Alternative model (Richardson at HEW) showing different way
- Financial independence - ability to walk away
- Strong personal ethics - refused to mix personal business with White House
- Willingness to quit - "take this job and shove it"
- Professional identity separate from political loyalty
- Recognition of system's dysfunction even while participating

**Anti-Sycophantic Behaviors**:
- Threatened to quit when abused
- Found creative solution (commercial flight) when given impossible deadline
- Refused to use personal business for White House vetting
- Told Haldeman directly it was "horrible" and "nightmare"
- Didn't visit Haldeman in jail - maintained boundaries
- Built business on opposite principles - "how not to treat people"
- Maintained that Richardson model was better

## Broader Significance

This interview is extraordinary for its explicit, detailed description of fear-based sycophancy. Unlike other interviews that describe systems abstractly, Huntsman provides visceral accounts:
- The door flying open, Haldeman screaming "you're one dumb son of a bitch"
- Haldeman spinning around at exactly 10:00 saying "Shoot"
- Staff members saying "check" and moving on to avoid saying something "silly"
- "It took me years to get over the fear of Haldeman"
- "Terrorizing time in my life" (repeated multiple times)
- "I didn't take anything but fear out"

The interview also provides crucial insight into Watergate's antecedents: the system was so tightly controlled that people had to do "something unusual" to "get his head above the crowd" and "get attention." This links excessive hierarchical control directly to rule-breaking behavior - staff needed to circumvent the system to gain favor.

Huntsman's later success ($8 billion company) built on opposite principles validates his critique - he proved that fear-based management is unnecessary for efficiency. His main lesson was "how not to treat people."

Most poignant: Even Haldeman admitted "I'd never ask you to run a business like this. I'd never run anything else like this." He knew it was abusive but chose to do it anyway in the White House context, suggesting that government position enabled/encouraged behavior Haldeman wouldn't use elsewhere.
