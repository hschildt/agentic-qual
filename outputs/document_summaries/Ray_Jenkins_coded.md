# Jimmy Carter Transition - Ray Jenkins Interview
**Date**: September 8, 1999
**Interviewee**: Ray Jenkins (Assistant to the President, Press Office)
**Interviewer**: Martha Kumar

## Document Summary
Jenkins discusses his role in the Carter Press Office, focusing on press relations, coordination with departments, and the dynamics of serving the President vs. serving the press. Key themes include learning curve of understanding Washington culture, the role of access and proximity to power, and Jody Powell's integrity-based leadership style.

## Coded Excerpts

### 1. Learning to Serve the President, Not the Press
> "It's so obvious that I'm almost ashamed to say it. I went there thinking that my role was to serve the press. My role was to serve the President. It's that simple. If their interests were in conflict, then that meant that my loyalties lay with the President, not with the press. I thought that I was going there to help out the press. I helped out the press best by representing the President's interests. Any time that I had some impulse to act like a reporter—I think in general it's probably not a good idea to get somebody who has as much experience and is steeped in journalism as I was, in the role of a Press Secretary, because it's all but impossible to put your previous life behind you, particularly when you feel this real obligation to report news when that's what's been ingrained in you ever since you took journalism 101. Then, all of a sudden, you may be in the position of suppressing news." (p.10)

**Codes**: learning-loyalty-shift, serve-president-not-constituency, role-confusion, journalism-background-problem
**Memo**: CRITICAL REALIZATION about sycophancy vs. independence! Jenkins took six months to learn that his loyalty was to President, not press. This is the fundamental dynamic - staff must subordinate professional identity/ethics to presidential service. Jenkins admits he went there to "help out the press" but learned he helped press best by "representing President's interests" - euphemism for sycophantic loyalty. Suggests hiring people with strong professional identities (journalists) creates conflict with sycophantic demands of White House.

### 2. Choosing West Wing for Status - A Mistake
> "Probably the first mistake that I made—and this does to some extent have to do with transition. I guess Jody said, 'Do you want an office here in the West Wing, or over in the Executive Office Building?' Well, my heavens, he shouldn't have asked that; he should have assigned me an office in the Executive Office Building because that was much more akin to my role that I was supposed to be playing, sitting around calling editors all day long and setting up special interviews of one kind or another. I chose to be in the West Wing, for heaven's sake. It's almost human nature that you would do that. It was a mistake." (p.10)

**Codes**: proximity-to-power-seeking, status-over-function, west-wing-prestige, natural-tendency-mistake
**Memo**: Jenkins explicitly identifies choosing West Wing office for proximity/status as mistake - demonstrates how sycophantic dynamics (seeking proximity to power) override functional considerations. "It's almost human nature that you would do that" - acknowledges universal temptation. Consequence: three top press people crowded together, getting in each other's way, rather than optimal distribution. Antecedent: human desire for status/proximity. Jody "shouldn't have asked" - should have assigned functionally appropriate office rather than letting status-seeking drive decision.

### 3. Too Many Staff = Getting in President's Way
> "They all want to meet with him, you know. There's nothing like a meeting with the President. The more people you've got around—it's like going to a football game. If you have a crowded football game it takes a lot longer to get out of it. I'm just much in favor of it and particularly keeping some distance. I think an awful lot of these people could be in the Cabinets, rather than in the Executive Office Building. You certainly do have to have advisers. I think that probably goes over about everything that…" (p.21)

**Codes**: access-seeking-universal, meeting-with-president-currency, staff-bloat-problem, proximity-crowding
**Memo**: Jenkins identifies core sycophantic dynamic - "They all want to meet with him...There's nothing like a meeting with the President." More staff = more people seeking access, creating crowding/inefficiency. Suggests keeping staff small and at distance to reduce access-seeking behavior. This is consequence of sycophancy: people drawn to White House want proximity to power, creating organizational dysfunction.

### 4. Trudy Feldman - Pre-Vetting Stories for Access
> "I hate to get into personalities but it was well known: if you had something that you wanted to publish pretty much in the form of a press release, if you did an interview with Trudy you could get it done. I'm almost reluctant to say it, but I'm going to say it, because she came to me once with a story she had written and wanted me to read it. See, she had more one-on-one interviews with President Carter than any single reporter there. But she came to me with a story that she had written about one her interviews and wanted me to read it over before it was published and even said, 'If you don't like anything in it, you can change it.' That's why Trudy got so many interviews." (p.16)

**Codes**: access-for-compliance, pre-vetting-stories, sycophantic-journalist, interview-access-trade
**Memo**: Perfect example of sycophantic journalist! Feldman traded editorial control for access - let White House pre-vet and even change her stories in exchange for "more one-on-one interviews with President Carter than any single reporter." This is transactional sycophancy: journalist abandons independence/integrity to gain privileged access. White House rewarded compliant journalist with interviews while withholding from critical ones. "That's why Trudy got so many interviews" - explicit acknowledgment of quid pro quo.

### 5. Selecting Favorable vs. Hostile Journalists
> "Jody, in particular, would identify people that he thought would be friendlier toward the President than others. For God's sake, no Press Secretary in his right mind would set up an interview with Maureen Dowd with the President. I argued against an interview with Barbara Walters because I think she tended to set traps and, in fact, she did, in an interview...Yes. You pick people that you think are going to be favorable to your side, at least give the President a good, decent break." (p.7)

**Codes**: selecting-favorable-press, avoiding-hostile-journalists, strategic-access-control, friend-vs-adversary
**Memo**: Strategic use of access to reward friendly journalists and punish hostile ones. "You pick people that you think are going to be favorable to your side" - creates incentive structure encouraging sycophantic journalism. Journalists who want presidential access must demonstrate friendliness. Jenkins argued against Barbara Walters because "she tended to set traps" - critical journalism punished with access denial. This system cultivates sycophancy in press corps.

### 6. Jody Powell's Integrity - Anti-Sycophantic Leadership
> "Jody's personal relationships were his strongest points. He's a man of enormous integrity. Everybody knew they could trust Jody and they knew that he had no personal agendas, that he was serving the President. He was trying to make the Administration work...one of the most touching things I remember was when some very low-level intern, I believe, at the White House had gotten in deep trouble...Her whole life stood to be affected by this. Jody came to bat for her and stood up for her...I think people saw him that way, as a very compassionate, highly intelligent but humane person in the end. He's really one of my favorite people." (p.14)

**Codes**: powell-integrity, no-personal-agenda, compassionate-leadership, standing-up-for-subordinate
**Memo**: Powell as anti-sycophantic leader - "no personal agendas," served President authentically rather than self-promotingly. Protected vulnerable subordinate when "would have been awfully easy just to throw this person to the wolves." This is protective factor against pathological sycophancy: leader with integrity, compassion, and willingness to shield subordinates. Contrast with leaders who sacrifice subordinates to protect themselves. Powell's integrity earned trust, making people want to serve him/President effectively rather than performatively.

### 7. Brzezinski as "Rasputin" - Suspicion of Proximity
> "This is almost in-house gossip here, but he [Brzezinski] was regarded by the White House staff with great suspicion and kind of a Rasputin who exerted this inordinate control over the President because he had a meeting with him every morning at 7:15. It was his and his alone. I know that there was real hostility between—really it was more from Stu Eizenstat to Brzezinski than it was the other way around. I think Brzezinski was very secure in his position. What I really would like to know would be the relations between Brzezinski and Cyrus Vance. From my perspective Cyrus Vance, he was too honorable a man to be in a fight with a street fighter like Brzezinski. I was one of the ones who didn't like Brzezinski. I don't think anybody in the White House liked him. I don't think his own staff liked him." (p.22)

**Codes**: brzezinski-rasputin, inordinate-control, morning-meeting-exclusive-access, street-fighter-vs-honorable, universally-disliked
**Memo**: Brzezinski seen as sycophantic manipulator ("Rasputin") who leveraged exclusive daily access (7:15am meeting) to gain "inordinate control over President." Staff hostility driven by perception he was "street fighter" vs. honorable Vance - suggests Brzezinski used sycophantic tactics (flattery, proximity, manipulation) effectively. "I don't think anybody in the White House liked him. I don't think his own staff liked him" - yet he maintained power through presidential access. Shows how sycophancy can be effective despite creating resentment. Brzezinski "very secure in his position" because he understood access = power.

### 8. Carter's Micromanaging - Circling Typos Again
> "I remember the President once—one of the very few private remarks I've had. He asked me—again, it shows Jimmy Carter's tendency to manage too much. He said, 'Isn't there something you can do to get him to stop smoking?' I said, 'Mr. President, you can ask a lot, but that's one thing you can't do.'" (p.14)

**Codes**: carter-micromanaging, inappropriate-delegation, managing-too-much
**Memo**: Another example of Carter's micromanaging - asking Jenkins to control Jody's smoking! "Shows Jimmy Carter's tendency to manage too much." This creates environment where staff must attend to minutiae to satisfy president's need for control. Micromanaging creates sycophantic responses - staff must demonstrate attention to details president cares about regardless of importance.

### 9. Carter Reviewing Own Performance - Self-Assessment
> "He gave a press conference and I was sitting at Jody's desk and the phone rang. It was the direct line from the President. I picked it up and it was the President. He said, 'Could you call the whatever office it was and tell them to rerun the press conference?'...He said something to the effect of 'I want to see what mistakes I made.' So he was assessing his own performance." (p.23)

**Codes**: carter-self-assessment, reviewing-own-performance, seeking-improvement
**Memo**: Carter's self-critical approach - wanted to review press conference to see "what mistakes I made." This is anti-sycophantic trait in leader - seeking honest self-assessment rather than validation. However, creates environment where staff must be critical too, which can conflict with sycophantic expectations. Leader who reviews own mistakes sets tone for honest feedback vs. flattery.

### 10. Access Trade-Off - Editors Getting Treasury Secretary
> "If the New York Times economics columnist, if we wanted him to have access to the Treasury Secretary, they would make their own arrangements. They wouldn't need me to do it. But someone who is a little below that level, say the editor of the Chicago Tribune, I could set him up with an interview with Charlie Schultze, the President's Council of Economics adviser. They'd talk fifteen or twenty minutes and, without exception, whenever this was done, the editorials served the President's interest much better, and I think served the public's interest much better, than having an editor write something without really knowing all of the facts on it." (p.12)

**Codes**: access-as-currency, favorable-coverage-through-access, serving-presidents-interest, information-control
**Memo**: Jenkins describes using access to administration officials as tool to shape favorable coverage - "editorials served the President's interest much better" after granting interviews. This is soft sycophancy cultivation - rewarding journalists with access/information in exchange for favorable coverage. Jenkins frames as "serving public interest" but acknowledges primary goal is serving "President's interest." Creates incentive for journalists to be friendly to maintain access pipeline.

### 11. Three Types of White House Staff
> "I think that there are, for want of a better word, policy nerds. Stuart Eizenstat comes to mind. He did his job extremely well. He thought through policy very carefully. Stuart is very close to a professional politician in the British sense, the Parliamentary sense...Then there are others; there are some who are simply egotists and who just want to be close to the center of power. There are very dedicated people like Jody, who is really not a big policy man, but wants to make the whole thing work. Hamilton Jordan would fall into that category, too. They are some of the smartest people I ever met." (p.23-24)

**Codes**: policy-nerds, egotists-seeking-proximity, dedicated-servants, typology-of-staff
**Memo**: Jenkins identifies three types: (1) Policy nerds who love substance (Eizenstat); (2) Egotists who "just want to be close to the center of power" - pure sycophants seeking proximity; (3) Dedicated people who want to make things work (Powell, Jordan). Type 2 is problematic sycophancy - motivated by power-proximity rather than policy or service. Jenkins suggests this type exists in every White House. Question is ratio and whether leaders can identify/minimize egotists while empowering nerds and dedicated servants.

### 12. No Rigging Press Conferences
> "There was never any rigging of the press conference, not during my tenure there, that I'm aware. Now it's conceivable that Jody may have had his own private arrangements. You could ask him about that...We felt that the function of the press was to frame its own questions and it was not the function of the White House Press Office to frame them for them." (p.4)

**Codes**: no-rigging-press-conferences, press-independence-respected, ethical-boundary
**Memo**: Jenkins reports Carter Press Office maintained ethical boundary - didn't rig press conferences or plant questions (contrast with LBJ). Some reporters offered to take planted questions in exchange for being called on, but "we weren't about to get into that." This is anti-sycophantic practice - respecting press independence even when could manipulate for advantage. However, this operated alongside other access-control mechanisms (selecting favorable journalists, rewarding friendly coverage).

### 13. Coordinating Sunday Talk Shows - Top-Down Control
> "I remember—again, I don't want to get too close to quoting the President but I know that there was some concern when an Assistant Secretary of State, Marshall Shulman was his name, for one reason or another he went on to one of the Sunday talk shows without clearing it with the proper people. It caused a lot of problems around the White House. Not problems, but it—...raised some questions and said: 'We shouldn't allow this kind of thing to happen.' And it came from the very top, those questions did. Obviously what happened was the President was watching television—" (p.21-22)

**Codes**: sunday-show-clearance-required, unauthorized-appearance-problems, top-down-message-control, president-watching
**Memo**: Assistant Secretary going on Sunday show without clearance "caused a lot of problems" - President himself watching and raising questions about lack of control. This is manifestation of hierarchical message control - all public appearances must be cleared to ensure consistent sycophantic messaging. Consequence of unauthorized appearance: anxiety, questions "from the very top." Creates atmosphere where officials must seek permission/approval before any public communication. Antecedent: desire for message discipline. Consequence: staff fear of speaking without clearance.

### 14. Learning Curve - Six Months to Understand
> "Probably more about how Washington works, the Washington culture. The White House culture and the Washington culture, which are separate; the Congressional culture; nothing more than I wish I had been able to learn faster than I was [learning]. I felt, by the time I left, maybe I had reached a point in the learning curve where I could actually help the President some. Of course, by that time, it's too late. And of course that's true of many, many other people...Including him, too." (p.19)

**Codes**: steep-learning-curve, six-months-to-learn, too-late-when-learned, president-learning-too
**Memo**: Jenkins took six months to learn how to be effective - "by the time I left, maybe I had reached a point in the learning curve where I could actually help the President some. Of course, by that time, it's too late." This learning curve includes understanding sycophantic dynamics - whom to defer to, how to serve President vs. press, navigating access and power. "And of course that's true of many, many other people. Including him, too" - even Carter learning. This is antecedent for organizational dysfunction: by time staff understand system, administration is half over.

### 15. Iranian Hostage Crisis Consuming All Time
> "It wasn't just Jody. It was the President's time as well. The political emotions were just so high, not to speak of the fact that you had the possibility of starting a war or getting fifty-eight people killed. That was what was uppermost in the President's mind. I couldn't begin to quantify what percentage of the President's time was spent on it, but I dare say it was at least 50 per cent from early November of 1979 to the end of the Administration...It certainly took at least as much of Jody's time as it did of the President's." (p.19)

**Codes**: hostage-crisis-dominating, fifty-percent-presidential-time, distortive-crisis, jody-consumed
**Memo**: Crisis consumed 50%+ of presidential time for over a year - demonstrates how external events can overwhelm organizational dynamics. Jenkins' job changed dramatically because Jody had to devote "virtually all of his time to the Iranian hostage thing." This disrupted normal sycophantic patterns - Jenkins couldn't do job he came for because had to take over other responsibilities. Shows how crisis can both intensify sycophancy (everyone focused on presidential priority) and disrupt it (normal access patterns broken).

## Key Themes Related to Sycophancy

1. **Learning to Serve President vs. Constituency**: Jenkins' six-month learning curve to understand loyalty was to President, not press - fundamental shift from professional identity to sycophantic service

2. **Proximity-Seeking**: Choosing West Wing office for status despite functional inappropriateness; universal desire to meet with President creating crowding

3. **Access as Currency**: Trudy Feldman trading editorial independence for access; selecting favorable journalists and avoiding hostile ones

4. **Brzezinski as Manipulator**: Seen as "Rasputin" leveraging exclusive morning access to gain control despite being universally disliked

5. **Jody Powell's Integrity**: Anti-sycophantic leadership through integrity, compassion, lack of personal agenda - protective factor

6. **Three Staff Types**: Policy nerds, dedicated servants, and egotists seeking power-proximity

7. **Message Control**: Sunday show appearances requiring clearance; President monitoring and questioning unauthorized appearances

8. **Steep Learning Curve**: Took six months for Jenkins (and others, including Carter) to understand how to navigate Washington/White House culture

## Connections to Sycophancy Framework

**Antecedents**:
- Human desire for proximity to power ("It's almost human nature")
- Brzezinski's exclusive daily access to President
- Career journalists' need for access to do their jobs
- Unclear about where loyalty should lie (press vs. President)

**Manifestations**:
- Choosing West Wing office for status over function
- Trudy Feldman allowing story pre-vetting for access
- Brzezinski's "Rasputin" manipulation through proximity
- Staff all wanting meetings with President
- Journalists moderating criticism to maintain access
- Assistant Secretary seeking clearance before Sunday shows

**Consequences**:
- Three top press people crowded together, inefficient
- Favorable coverage for compliant journalists, none for critical ones
- Brzezinski gaining "inordinate control" through access
- Assistant Secretary causing "problems" by appearing without clearance
- Jenkins taking six months to learn role = late effectiveness

**Protective Factors**:
- Powell's integrity, compassion, lack of personal agenda
- Carter's self-critical approach, reviewing own mistakes
- Ethical boundary against rigging press conferences
- Policy nerds focused on substance over proximity
- Jenkins' journalism background (though initially problematic, provided critical perspective once he learned role)
