# Qualitative Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sycophancy in different presidential transitions based on interviews. Each transition is in the data subfolder; folder name = incoming president.

## Analysis Approach

- Methodology: Grounded theory with Gioia method, focus on SYCOPHANCY and its antecedents and consequences
- Unit of analysis: Sycophancy in different presidential transitions (subfolders in data/)
- Be economical in analyzing documents, only incorporate things that are relevant to sycophancy
- Create memos around sycophancy, its antecedents, and its outcomes. Try to collect evidence of linkages between constructs.
- Form up to three alternative theoretical models in the form of boxes & arrows diagram, a short description, and a table of illustrative quotes.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Familiarization**: Read and summarize each data file from the perspective of research question.
2. **Initial Coding**: Generate descriptive codes, save to codebook.md.
3. **Code Refinement**: Group and consolidate codes; organize data separately for presidential transitions.
4. **Theme Development**: Identify patterns across codes.
5. **Report Generation**: Produce memos on key topics, then use them to create 1-3 theoretical models.

## File Conventions

- Document level data: `outputs/document_summaries/[original_filename]_coded.md`
- Memos: `analysis/thematic_summaries/memo_[topic]_[date].md`
- Theoretical models: `outputs/theoretical_model/model_[name].md`

## Output Format for Coded Data

Use this structure:

```
[Original text excerpt]
**Codes**: [code1], [code2]
**Memo**: [brief analytical note]
```
