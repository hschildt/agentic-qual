# Example dataset & results for qualitative research with AI

## The White House Transition Project interviews from 2000.
This is a freely available example dataset for AI coding with AI results.

## Sycophancy analysis
One interesting aspect of the dataset (from my personal perspective) was the sycophancy towards the president that popped up explicitly in the Clinton transition, but was quite explicit in other materials. I decided to use this as a way to gauge the quality of AI models for qualitative analysis. 

## Method & tools
more about that later!

## Other notes
After conducting the analysis, I asked Claude Code to search online for research on "ingratiation" and make a structured comparison. I did not provide any other instructions. The result of that task is here:[
