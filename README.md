# Example dataset & results for qualitative research with AI

## The White House Transition Project interviews from 2000.
This is a freely available example dataset for AI coding with AI results.

## Sycophancy analysis
One interesting aspect of the dataset (from my personal perspective) was the sycophancy towards the president that popped up explicitly in the Clinton transition, but was quite explicit in other materials. I decided to use this as a way to gauge the quality of AI models for qualitative analysis. 

## Method & tools
more about that later!

## Other notes
*"Excellent catch! The data shows ALL interviews from ALL 6 transitions were coded, but the framework only analyzed 4 transitions. Let me check the
   memos to see where this divergence happened."*
